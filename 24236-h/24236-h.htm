<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is my privilege to address you this afternoon
on a subject in which science and poetry are
blended in a happy conjunction. If there be a
peculiar fascination about the earlier chapters of
any branch of history, how great must be the
interest which attaches to that most primeval of
all terrestrial histories which relates to the actual
beginnings of this globe on which we stand.</p>

<p>In our efforts to grope into the dim recesses of
this awful past, we want the aid of some steadfast
light which shall illumine the dark places without
the treachery of the will-o'-the-wisp. In the
absence of that steadfast light, vague conjectures
as to the beginning of things could never be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
entitled to any more respect than was due to
mere matters of speculation.</p>

<p>Of late, however, the required light has been to
some considerable extent forthcoming, and the
attempt has been made, with no little success, to
elucidate a most interesting and wonderful chapter
of an exceedingly remote history. To chronicle
this history is the object of the present lectures
before this Institution.</p>

<p>First, let us be fully aware of the extraordinary
remoteness of that period of which our history
treats. To attempt to define that period chronologically
would be utterly futile. When we have
stated that it is more ancient than almost any other
period which we can discuss, we have expressed
all that we are really entitled to say. Yet this
conveys not a little. It directs us to look back
through all the ages of modern human history,
through the great days of ancient Greece and
Rome, back through the times when Egypt and
Assyria were names of renown, through the days
when Nineveh and Babylon were mighty and
populous cities in the zenith of their glory. Back
earlier still to those more ancient nations of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
we know hardly anything, and still earlier to
the prehistoric man, of whom we know less; back,
finally, to the days when man first trod on this
planet, untold ages ago. Here is indeed a portentous
retrospect from most points of view, but
it is only the commencement of that which our
subject suggests.</p>

<p>For man is but the final product of the long
anterior ages during which the development of life
seems to have undergone an exceedingly gradual
elevation. Our retrospect now takes its way along
the vistas opened up by the geologists. We look
through the protracted tertiary ages, when mighty
animals, now generally extinct, roamed over the
continents. Back still earlier through those wondrous
secondary periods, where swamps or oceans
often covered what is now dry land, and where
mighty reptiles of uncouth forms stalked and
crawled and swam through the old world and the
new. Back still earlier through those vitally significant
ages when the sunbeams were being
garnered and laid aside for man's use in the great
forests, which were afterwards preserved by being
transformed into seams of coal. Back still earlier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
through endless thousands of years, when lustrous
fishes abounded in the oceans; back again to those
periods characterized by the lower types of life;
and still earlier to that incredibly remote epoch
when life itself began to dawn on our awakening
globe. Even here the epoch of our present history
can hardly be said to have been reached. We
have to look through a long succession of ages
still antecedent. The geologist, who has hitherto
guided our view, cannot render us much further
assistance; but the physicist is at hand&mdash;he teaches
us that the warm globe on which life is beginning
has passed in its previous stages through every
phase of warmth, of fervour, of glowing heat, of
incandescence, and of actual fusion; and thus at
last our retrospect reaches to that particular period
of our earth's past history which is specially
illustrated by the modern doctrine of Time and
Tide.</p>

<p>The present is the clue to the past. It is the
steady application of this principle which has led
to such epoch-making labours as those by which
Lyell disclosed the origin of the earth's crust,
Darwin the origin of species, Max M&uuml;ller the origin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of language. In our present subject the course is
equally clear. Study exactly what is going on at
present, and then have the courage to apply consistently
and rigorously what we have learned
from the present to the interpretation of the
past.</p>

<p>Thus we begin with the ripple of the tide on the
sea-beach which we see to-day. The ebb and the
flow of the tide are the present manifestations of
an agent which has been constantly at work. Let
that present teach us what tides must have done in
the indefinite past.</p>

<p>It has been known from the very earliest times
that the moon and the tides were connected
together&mdash;connected, I say, for a great advance
had to be made in human knowledge before it
would have been possible to understand the true
relation between the tides and the moon. Indeed,
that relation is so far from being of an obvious
character, that I think I have read of a race who
felt some doubt as to whether the moon was the
cause of the tides, or the tides the cause of the
moon. I should, however, say that the moon is
not the sole agent engaged in producing this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
periodic movement of our waters. The sun also
arouses a tide, but the solar tide is so small in
comparison with that produced by the moon, that
for our present purpose we may leave it out of
consideration. We must, however, refer to the
solar tide at a later period of our discourses, for it
will be found to have played a very splendid part
at the initial stage of the Earth-Moon History,
while in the remote future it will again rise into
prominence.</p>

<p>It will be well to set forth a few preliminary
figures which shall explain how it comes to pass
that the efficiency of the sun as a tide-producing
agent is so greatly inferior to that of the moon.
Indeed, considering that the sun has a mass so
stupendous, that it controls the entire planetary
system, how is it that a body so insignificant as the
moon can raise a bigger tide on the ocean than
can the sun, of which the mass is 26,000,000 times
as great as that of our satellite?</p>

<p>This apparent paradox will disappear when we
enunciate the law according to which the efficiency
of a tide-producing agent is to be estimated. This
law is somewhat different from the familiar form in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which the law of gravitation is expressed. The
gravitation between two distant masses is to be
measured by multiplying these masses together,
and dividing the product by the <i>square</i> of the distance.
The law for expressing the efficiency of a
tide-producing agent varies not according to the
inverse square, but according to the inverse <i>cube</i>
of the distance. This difference in the expression
of the law will suffice to account for the superiority
of the moon as a tide-producer over the sun. The
moon's distance on an average is about one
386th part of that of the sun, and thus it is easy
to show that so far as the mere attraction of gravitation
is concerned, the efficiency of the sun's force
on the earth is about one hundred and seventy-five
times as great as the force with which the moon
attracts the earth. That is of course calculated
under the law of the inverse square. To determine
the tidal efficiency we have to divide this by three
hundred and eighty-six, and thus we see that the
tidal efficiency of the sun is less than half that of
the moon.</p>

<p>When the solar tide and the lunar tide are acting
in unison, they conspire to produce very high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
tides and very low tides, or, as we call them, spring
tides. On the other hand, when the sun is so
placed as to give us a low tide while the moon is
producing a high tide, the net result that we
actually experience is merely the excess of the lunar
tide over the solar tide; these are what we call neap
tides. In fact, by very careful and long-continued
observations of the rise and fall of the tides at a
particular port, it becomes possible to determine
with accuracy the relative ranges of spring tides
and neap tides; and as the spring tides are produced
by moon plus sun, while the neap tides
are produced by moon minus sun, we obtain a
means of actually weighing the relative masses of
the sun and moon. This is one of the remarkable
facts which can be deduced from a prolonged study
of the tides.</p>

<p>The demonstration of the law of the tide-producing
force is of a mathematical character, and
I do not intend in these lectures to enter into
mathematical calculations. There is, however, a
simple line of reasoning which, though it falls far
short of actual demonstration, may yet suffice to
give a plausible reason for the law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The tides really owe their origin to the fact that
the tide-producing agent operates more powerfully
on those parts of the tide-exhibiting body which
are near to it, than on the more distant portions of
the same. The nearer the two bodies are together,
the larger proportionally will be the differences in
the distances of its various parts from the tide-producing
body; and on this account the leverage, so
to speak, of the action by which the tides are
produced is increased. For instance, if the two
bodies were brought within half their original distance
of each other, the relative size of each body,
as viewed from the other, will be doubled; and
what we have called the leverage of the tide-producing
ability will be increased twofold. The
gravitation also between the two bodies is increased
fourfold when the distance is halved, and
consequently, the tide-producing ability is doubled
for one reason, and increased fourfold again by
another; hence, the tides will be increased eightfold
when the distance is reduced to one half.
Now, as eight is the cube of two, this illustration
may be taken as a verification of the law, that
the efficiency of a body as a tide-producer varies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
inversely as the cube of the distance between it
and the body on which the tides are being raised.</p>

<p>For simplicity we may make the assumption
that the whole of the earth is buried beneath the
ocean, and that the moon is placed in the plane
of the equator. We may also entirely neglect for
the present the tides produced by the sun, and we
shall also make the further assumption that friction
is absent. What friction is capable of doing
we shall, however, refer to later on. The moon
will act on the ocean and deform it, so that there
will be high tide along one meridian, and high
tide also on the opposite meridian. This is indeed
one of the paradoxes by which students are
frequently puzzled when they begin to learn
about the tides. That the moon should pull the
water up in a heap on one side seems plausible
enough. High tide will of course be there; and the
student might naturally think that the water being
drawn in this way into a heap on one side, there
will of course be low tide on the opposite side of
the earth. A natural assumption, perhaps, but
nevertheless a very wrong one. There are at
every moment two opposite parts of the earth in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a condition of high water; in fact, this will be
obvious if we remember that every day, or, to speak
a little more accurately, in every twenty-four hours
and fifty one minutes, we have on the average
two high tides at each locality. Of course this
could not be if the moon raised only one heap
of high water, because, as the moon only appears
to revolve around the earth once a day, or, more
accurately, once in that same average period of
twenty-four hours and fifty-one minutes, it would
be impossible for us to have high tides succeeding
each other as they do in periods a little longer
than twelve hours, if only one heap were carried
round the earth.</p>

<p>The first question then is, as to how these two
opposite heaps of water are placed in respect to
the position of the moon. The most obvious explanation
would seem to be, that the moon should
pull the waters up into a heap directly underneath
it, and that therefore there should be high water
underneath the moon. As to the other side, the
presence of a high tide there was, on this theory,
to be accounted for by the fact that the moon
pulled the earth away from the waters on the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
remote side, just as it pulled the waters away from
the more remote earth on the side underneath the
moon. It is, however, certainly not the case that
the high tide is situated in the simple position
that this law would indicate, and which we have
represented in Fig. 1, where the circular body is
the earth, the ocean surrounding which is distorted
by the action of the tides.</p>

<img src="images/illo001.jpg" width="350" height="266" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 1</p>

<p>We have here taken an oval to represent the
shape into which the water is supposed to be
forced or drawn by the tidal action of the tide-producing
body. This may possibly be a correct
representation of what would occur on an ideal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
globe entirely covered with a frictionless ocean.
But as our earth is not covered entirely by water,
and as the ocean is very far from being frictionless,
the ideal tide is not the tide that we actually know;
nor is the ideal tide represented by this oval even
an approximation to the actual tides to which
our oceans are subject. Indeed, the oval does not
represent the facts at all, and of this it is only
necessary to adduce a single fact in demonstration.
I take the fundamental issue so often debated, as
to whether in the ocean vibrating with ideal tides
the high water or the low water should be under
the moon. Or to put the matter otherwise; when
we represent the displaced water by an oval, is
the long axis of the oval to be turned to the
moon, as generally supposed, or is it to be directed
at right angles therefrom? If the ideal tides were
in any degree representative of the actual tides, so
fundamental a question as this could be at once
answered by an appeal to the facts of observation.
Even if friction in some degree masked the phenomena,
surely one would think that the state of
the actual tides should still enable us to answer
this question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But a study of the tides at different ports fails
to realize this expectation. At some ports, no
doubt, the tide is high when the moon is on the
meridian. In that case, of course, the high water
is under the moon, as apparently ought to be the
case invariably, on a superficial view. But, on
the other hand, there are ports where there is
often low water when the moon is crossing the
meridian. Yet other ports might be cited in
which every intermediate phase could be observed.
If the theory of the tides was to be the simple one
so often described, then at every port noon should
be the hour of high water on the day of the new
moon or of the full moon, because then both tide-exciting
bodies are on the meridian at the same
time. Even if the friction retarded the great tidal
wave uniformly, the high tide on the days of full
or change should always occur at fixed hours; but,
unfortunately, there is no such delightful theory
of the tides as this would imply. At Greenock
no doubt there is high water at or about noon on
the day of full or change; and if it could be similarly
said that on the day of full or change there
was high water everywhere at local noon, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the equilibrium theory of the tides, as it is called,
would be beautifully simple. But this is not the
case. Even around our own coasts the discrepancies
are such as to utterly discredit the theory
as offering any practical guide. At Aberdeen
the high tide does not appear till an hour later
than the doctrine would suggest. It is two hours
late at London, three at Tynemouth, four at Tralee,
five at Sligo, and six at Hull. This last port
would be indeed the haven of refuge for those
who believe that the low tide ought to be under
the moon. At Hull this is no doubt the case; and
if at all other places the water behaved as it does
at Hull, why then, of course, it would follow that
the law of low water under the moon was generally
true. But then this would not tally with the condition
of affairs at the other places I have named;
and to complete the cycle I shall add a few more.
At Bristol the high water does not get up until
seven hours after the moon has passed the meridian,
at Arklow the delay is eight hours, at Yarmouth
it is nine, at the Needles it is ten hours, while
lastly, the moon has nearly got back to the
meridian again ere it has succeeded in dragging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
up the tide on which Liverpool's great commerce
so largely depends.</p>

<p>Nor does the result of studying the tides along
other coasts beside our own decide more conclusively
on the mooted point. Even ports in the vast
ocean give a very uncertain response. Kerguelen
Island and Santa Cruz might seem to prove that
the high tide occurs under the moon, but unfortunately
both Fiji and Ascension seem to present us
with an equally satisfactory demonstration, that
beneath the moon is the invariable home of low
water.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the study of the tides
is in other respects such a confused subject as the
facts I have stated would seem to indicate. It
becomes rather puzzling, no doubt, when we compare
the tides at one port with the tides elsewhere.
The law and order are, then, by no means conspicuous,
they are often hardly discernible. But
when we confine our attention to the tides at a
single port, the problem becomes at once a very
intelligible one. Indeed, the investigation of the
tides is an easy subject, if we are contented with
a reasonably approximate solution; should, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it be necessary to discuss fully the tides at
any port, the theory of the method necessary for
doing so is available, and a most interesting and
beautiful theory it certainly is.</p>

<p>Let us then speak for a few moments about the
methods by which we can study the tides at a
particular port. The principle on which it is based
is a very simple one.</p>

<p>It is the month of August, the 18th, we shall
suppose, and we are going to enjoy a delicious
swim in the sea. We desire, of course, to secure a
high tide for the purpose of doing so, and we call
an almanac to help us. I refer to the Thom's
Dublin Directory, where I find the tide to be high
at 10h. 14m. on the morning of the 18th of August.
That will then be the time to go down to the
baths at Howth or Kingstown.</p>

<p>But what I am now going to discourse to you
about is not the delights of sea-bathing, it is rather
a different inquiry. I want to ask, How did the
people who prepared that almanac know years
beforehand, that on that particular day the tide
would be high at that particular hour? How do
they predict for every day the hour of high water?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and how comes it to pass that these predictions are
invariably correct?</p>

<p>We first refer to that wonderful book, the <i>Nautical
Almanac</i>. In that volume the movements of
the moon are set forth with full detail; and among
other particulars we can learn on page iv of every
month the mean time of the moon's meridian
passage. It appears that on the day in question
the moon crossed the meridian at 11h. 23m. Thus
we see there was high water at Dublin at 10h.
14m., and 1h. 9m. later, that is, at 11h. 23m., the
moon crossed the meridian.</p>

<p>Let us take another instance. There is a high
tide at 3.40 <small>P.M.</small> on the 25th August, and again
the infallible <i>Nautical Almanac</i> tells us that the
moon crossed the meridian at 5h. 44m., that is, at
2h. 4m. after the high water.</p>

<p>In the first case the moon followed the tide in
about an hour, and in the second case the moon
followed in about two hours. Now if we are to be
satisfied with a very rough tide rule for Dublin,
we may say generally that there is always a high
tide an hour and a half before the moon crosses
the meridian. This would not be a very accurate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
rule, but I can assure you of this, that if you go
by it you will never fail of finding a good tide to
enable you to enjoy your swim. I do not say this
rule would enable you to construct a respectable
tide-table. A ship-owner who has to creep up the
river, and to whom often the inches of water are
material, will require far more accurate tables than
this simple rule could give. But we enter into
rather complicated matters when we attempt to
give any really accurate methods of computation.
On these we shall say a few words presently.
What I first want to do, is to impress upon you in
a simple way the fact of the relation between the
tide and the moon.</p>

<p>To give another illustration, let us see how the
tides at London Bridge are related to the moon.
On Jan. 1st, 1887, it appeared that the tide was
high at 6h. 26m. <small>P.M.</small>, and that the moon had
crossed the meridian 56m. previously; on the 8th
Jan. the tide was high at 0h. 43m. <small>P.M.</small>, and the
moon had crossed the meridian 2h. 1m. previously.
Therefore we would have at London Bridge high
water following the moon's transit in somewhere
about an hour and a half.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>I choose a day at random, for example&mdash;the
12th April. The moon crosses the upper meridian
at 3h. 39m. <small>A.M.</small>, and the lower meridian at 4h
6m. <small>P.M.</small> Adding an hour and a half to each
would give the high tides at 5h 9m. <small>A.M.</small> and
5h. 36m. <small>P.M.</small>; as a matter of fact, they are 4h.
58m. <small>A.M.</small> and 5h. 20m. <small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>But these illustrations are sufficient. We find
that at London, in a general way, high water
appears at London Bridge about an hour and a
half after the moon has passed the meridian of
London. It so happens that the interval at Dublin
is about the same, <i>i.e.</i> an hour and a half; only
that in the latter case the high water precedes the
moon by that interval instead of following it. We
may employ the same simple process at other
places. Choose two days about a week distant;
find on each occasion the interval between the
transit of the moon and the time of high water,
then the mean of these two differences will always
give some notion of the interval between high
water and the moon's transit. If then we take
from the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> the time of the moon's
transit, and apply to it the correction proper for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
port, we shall always have a sufficiently good tide-table
to guide us in choosing a suitable time for
taking our swim or our walk by the sea-side;
though if you be the captain of a vessel, you will
not be so imprudent as to enter port without
taking counsel of the accurate tide-tables, for which
we are indebted to the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Every one who visits the sea-side, or who lives
at a sea-port, should know this constant for the
tides, which affect him and his movements so
materially. If he will discover it from his own
experience, so much the better.</p>

<p>The first point to be ascertained is the time of
high water. Do not take this from any local table;
you ought to observe it for yourself. You will go
to the pier head, or, better still, to some place where
the rise and fall of the mere waves of the sea will
not embarrass you in your work. You must note
by your watch the time when the tide is highest.
An accurate way of doing this will be to have a
scale on which you can measure the height at
intervals of five minutes about the time of high
water. You will then be able to conclude the
time at which the tide was actually at its highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
point; but even if no great accuracy be obtainable,
you can still get much interesting information, for
you will without much difficulty be right within
ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>The correction for the port is properly called the
&#8220;establishment,&#8221; this being the average time of
high water on the days of full and change of the
moon at the particular port in question.</p>

<p>We can considerably amend the elementary
notion of the tides which the former method has
given us, if we adopt the plan described by Dr.
Whewell in the first four editions of the <i>Admiralty
Manual of Scientific Inquiry</i>. We speak of the
interval between the transit of the moon and the
time of high water as the luni-tidal interval. Of
course at full and change this is the same thing as
the establishment, but for other phases of the moon
the establishment must receive a correction before
being used as the luni-tidal interval. The correction
is given by the following table&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Moon_transit"  border="1" rules="all" frame="void" cellpadding="5">

<tr><td colspan="12" style="border-bottom: hidden; text-align: left; font-size: 80%">Hour of Moon's transit after Sun:</td></tr>

<tr><td style="padding-right: 1em">0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td></tr>

<tr><td style="padding-right: 1em">0</td><td>-20m</td><td>-30m</td><td>-50m</td><td>-60m</td><td>-60m</td><td>-60m</td><td>-40m</td><td>-10m</td><td>+10m</td><td>+20m</td><td>+10m</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="12" style="border-top: hidden; text-align: left; font-size: 80%">Correction of establishment to find luni-tidal interval:</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Thus at a port where the establishment was 3h.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
25m., let us suppose that the transit of the moon
took place at 6 <small>P.M.</small>; then we correct the establishment
by -60m., and find the luni-tidal interval to
be 2h. 25m., and accordingly the high water takes
place at 8h. 25m. <small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>But even this method is only an approximation.
The study of the tides is based on accurate observation
of their rise and fall on different places
round the earth. To show how these observations
are to be made, and how they are to be discussed
and reduced when they have been made, I may
refer to the last edition of the <i>Admiralty Manual
of Scientific Inquiry</i>, 1886. For a complete study of
the tides at any port a self-registering tide-gauge
should be erected, on which not alone the heights
and times of high and low water should be depicted,
but also the continuous curve which shows at any
time the height of the water. In fact, the whole
subject of the practical observation and discussion
and prediction of tides is full of valuable instruction,
and may be cited as one of the most complete
examples of the modern scientific methods.</p>

<p>In the first place, the tide-gauge itself is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
delicate instrument; it is actuated by a float which
rises and falls with the water, due provision being
made that the mere influence of waves shall not
make it to oscillate inconveniently. The motion of
the float when suitably reduced by mechanism
serves to guide a pencil, which, acting on the paper
round a revolving drum, gives a faithful and unintermitting
record of the height of the water.</p>

<p>Thus what the tide-gauge does is to present to
us a long curved line of which the summits correspond
to the heights of high water, while the
depressions are the corresponding points of low
water. The long undulations of this curve are, however,
very irregular. At spring tides, when the sun
and the moon conspire, the elevations rise much
higher and the depressions sink much lower than
they do at neap tides, when the high water raised
by the moon is reduced by the action of the sun.
There are also many minor irregularities which
show the tides to be not nearly such simple phenomena
as might be at first supposed. But what
we might hastily think of as irregularities are, in
truth, the most interesting parts of the whole
phenomena. Just as in the observations of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
planets the study of the perturbations has led
us to results of the widest interest and instruction,
so it is these minor phenomena of the tides which
seem most pregnant with scientific interest.</p>

<p>The tide-gauge gives us an elaborate curve. How
are we to interpret that curve? Here indeed a
most beautiful mathematical theorem comes to our
aid. Just as ordinary sounds consist of a number
of undulations blended together, so the tidal wave
consists of a number of distinct undulations
superposed. Of these the ordinary lunar tide and
the ordinary solar tide are the two principal; but
there are also minor undulations, harmonics, so
to speak, some originating from the moon, some
originating from the sun, and some from both
bodies acting in concert.</p>

<p>In the study of sound we can employ an
acoustic apparatus for the purpose of decomposing
any proposed note, and finding not only the
main undulation itself, but the several superposed
harmonics which give to the note its timbre.
So also we can analyze the undulation of the
tide, and show the component parts. The decomposition
is effected by the process known as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
harmonic analysis. The principle of the method
may be very simply described. Let us fix our attention
on any particular &#8220;tide,&#8221; for so the various
elements are denoted. We can always determine
beforehand, with as much accuracy as we may
require, what the period of that tide will be. For
instance, the period of the lunar semi-diurnal tide
will of course be half the average time occupied
by the moon to travel round from the meridian
of any place until it regains the same meridian;
the period of the lunar diurnal tide will be
double as great; and there are fortnightly tides,
and others of periods still greater. The essential
point to notice is, that the periods of these tides
are given by purely astronomical considerations
from the periods of the motions theory, and do
not depend upon the actual observations.</p>

<p>We measure off on the curve the height of the
tide at intervals of an hour. The larger the
number of such measures that are available the
better; but even if there be only three hundred
and sixty or seven hundred and twenty consecutive
hours, then, as shown by Professor G.&nbsp;H.
Darwin in the <i>Admiralty Manual</i> already referred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to, it will still be possible to obtain a very competent
knowledge of the tides in the particular
port where the gauge has been placed.</p>

<p>The art (for such indeed it may be described) of
harmonic analysis consists in deducing from the
hourly observations the facts with regard to each
of the constituent tides. This art has been carried
to such perfection, that it has been reduced to a
very simple series of arithmetical operations.
Indeed it has now been found possible to call in
the aid of ingenious mechanism, by which the
labours of computation are entirely superseded.
The pointer of the harmonic analyzer has merely
to be traced over the curve which the tide-gauge
has drawn, and it is the function of the machine
to decompose the composite undulation into its
parts, and to exhibit the several constituent tides
whose confluence gives the total result.</p>

<p>As if nothing should be left to complete the
perfection of a process which, both from its theoretical
and its practical sides, is of such importance,
a machine for predicting tides has been designed,
constructed, and is now in ordinary use. When
by the aid of the harmonic analysis the effectiveness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of the several constituent tides affecting a port
have become fully determined, it is of course
possible to predict the tides for that port. Each
&#8220;tide&#8221; is a simple periodic rise and fall, and we can
compute for any future time the height of each
were it acting alone. These heights can all be
added together, and thus the height of the water
is obtained. In this way a tide-table is formed,
and such a table when complete will express not
alone the hours and heights of high water on every
day, but the height of the water at any intervening
hour.</p>

<p>The computations necessary for this purpose are
no doubt simple, so far as their principle is concerned;
but they are exceedingly tedious, and
any process must be welcomed which affords
mitigation of a task so laborious. The entire
theory of the tides owes much to Sir William
Thomson in the methods of observation and in
the methods of reduction. He has now completed
the practical parts of the subject by inventing and
constructing the famous tide-predicting engine.</p>

<p>The principle of this engine is comparatively
simple. There is a chain which at one end is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
fixed, and at the other end carries the pencil which
is pressed against the revolving drum on which
the prediction is to be inscribed. Between its
two ends the chain passes up and down over
pulleys. Each pulley corresponds to one of the
&#8220;tides,&#8221; and there are about a dozen altogether,
some of which exercise but little effect. Of course
if the centres of the pulleys were all fixed the pen
could not move, but the centre of each pulley
describes a circle with a radius proportional to the
amplitude of the corresponding tide, and in a
time proportional to the period of that tide. When
these pulleys are all set so as to start at the proper
phases, the motion is produced by turning round
a handle which makes the drum rotate, and sets
all the pulleys in motion. The tide curve is thus
rapidly drawn out; and so expeditious is the
machine, that the tides of a port for an entire year
can be completely worked out in a couple of
hours.</p>

<p>While the student or the philosopher who seeks
to render any account of the tide on dynamical
grounds is greatly embarrassed by the difficulties
introduced by friction, we, for our present purpose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in the study of the great romance of modern
science opened up to us by the theory of the tides,
have to welcome friction as the agent which gives
to the tides their significance from our point of
view.</p>

<p>There is the greatest difference between the
height of the rise and fall of the tide at different
localities. Out in mid-ocean, for instance, an island
like St. Helena is washed by a tide only about
three feet in range; an enclosed sea like the
Caspian is subject to no appreciable tides whatever,
while the Mediterranean, notwithstanding its connection
with the Atlantic, is still only subject to
very inconsiderable tides, varying from one foot to
a few feet. The statement that water always finds
its own level must be received, like many another
proposition in nature, with a considerable degree of
qualification. Long ere one tide could have found
its way through the Straits of Gibraltar in sufficient
volume to have appreciably affected the level of the
great inland sea, its effects would have been obliterated
by succeeding tides. On the other hand,
there are certain localities which expose a funnel-shape
opening to the sea; into these the great tidal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wave rushes, and as it passes onwards towards the
narrow part, the waters become piled up so as to
produce tidal phenomena of abnormal proportions.
Thus, in our own islands, we have in the Bristol
Channel a wide mouth into which a great tide
enters, and as it hurries up the Severn it produces
the extraordinary phenomenon of the Bore. The
Bristol Channel also concentrates the great wave
which gives Chepstow and Cardiff a tidal range of
thirty-seven or thirty-eight feet at springs, and
forces the sea up the river Avon so as to give
Bristol a wonderful tide. There is hardly any
more interesting spot in our islands for the observation
of tides than is found on Clifton Suspension
Bridge. From that beautiful structure you look
down on a poor and not very attractive stream,
which two hours later becomes transformed into a
river of ample volume, down which great ships are
navigated. But of all places in the world, the most
colossal tidal phenomena are those in the Bay of
Fundy. Here the Atlantic passes into a long
channel whose sides gradually converge. When
the great pulse of the tide rushes up this channel,
it is gradually accumulated into a mighty volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at the upper end, the ebb and flow of which at
spring tides extends through the astonishing range
of not less than fifty feet.</p>

<p>These discrepancies between the tides at different
places are chiefly due to the local formations
of the coasts and the sea-beds. Indeed, it seems
that if the whole earth were covered with an
uniform and deep ocean of water, the tides would
be excessively feeble. On no other supposition
can we reasonably account for the fact that our
barometric records fail to afford us any very
distinct evidence as to the existence of tides in
the atmosphere. For you will, of course, remember
that our atmosphere may be regarded as a deep
and vast ocean of air, which embraces the whole
earth, extending far above the loftiest summits of
the mountains.</p>

<p>It is one of the profoundest of nature's laws that
wherever friction takes place, energy has to be
consumed. Perhaps I ought rather to say transformed,
for of course it is now well known that
consumption of energy in the sense of absolute
loss is impossible. Thus, when energy is expended
in moving a body in opposition to the force of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
friction, or in agitating a liquid, the energy which
disappears in its mechanical form reappears in the
form of heat. The agitation of water by paddles
moving through it warms the water, and the
accession of heat thus acquired measures the
energy which has been expended in making the
paddles rotate. The motion of a liquid of which
the particles move among each other with friction,
can only be sustained by the incessant degradation
of energy from the mechanical form into the lower
form of diffused heat. Thus the very fact that the
tides are ebbing and flowing, and that there is
consequently incessant friction going on among
all the particles of water in the ocean, shows us
that there must be some great store of energy
constantly available to supply the incessant
draughts made upon it by the daily oscillation
of the tides. In addition to the mere friction
between the particles of water, there are also many
other ways in which the tides proclaim to us that
there is some great hoard of energy which is
continually accessible to their wants. Stand on
the bank of an estuary or river up and down
which a great tidal current ebbs and flows; you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
will see the water copiously charged with sediment
which the tide is bearing along. Engineers are
well aware of the potency of the tide as a vehicle
for transporting stupendous quantities of sand or
mud. A sand-bank impedes the navigation of a
river; the removal of that sand-bank would be a
task, perhaps, conceivably possible by the use of
steam dredges and other appliances, whereby vast
quantities of sand could be raised and transported
to another locality where they would be innocuous.
It is sometimes possible to effect the desired end
by applying the power of the tide. A sea-wall
judiciously thrown out will sometimes concentrate
the tide into a much narrower channel. Its daily
oscillations will be accomplished with greater
vehemence, and as the tide rushes furiously backwards
and forwards over the obstacle, the incessant
action will gradually remove it, and the impediment
to navigation may be cleared away. Here we
actually see the tides performing a piece of definite
and very laborious work, to accomplish which by the
more ordinary agents would be a stupendous task.</p>

<p>In some places the tides are actually harnessed
so as to accomplish useful work. I have read that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
underneath old London Bridge there used formerly
to be great water-wheels, which were turned by
the tide as it rushed up the river, and turned again,
though in the opposite way, by the ebbing tide.
These wheels were, I believe, employed to pump up
water, though it does not seem obvious for what
purposes the water would have been suitable.
Indeed in the ebb and flow all round our coasts
there is a potential source of energy which has
hitherto been allowed to run to waste. The tide
could be utilized in various ways. Many of you
will remember the floating mills on the Rhine.
They are vessels like paddle steamers anchored in
the rapid current. The flow of the river makes the
paddles rotate, and thus the machinery in the
interior is worked. Such craft moored in a rapid
tide-way could also be made to convey the power
of the tides into the mechanism of the mill. Or there
is still another method which has been employed,
and which will perhaps have a future before it in
those approaching times when the coal-cellars of
England shall be exhausted. Imagine on the sea-coast
a large flat extent which is inundated twice
every day by the tide. Let us build a stout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
wall round this area, and provide it with a sluice-gate.
Open the gate as the tide rises, and the
great pond will be filled; then at the moment of
high water close the sluice, and the pond-full will
be impounded. If at low tide the sluice be opened
the water will rush tumultuously out. Now suppose
that a water-wheel be provided, so that the rapid
rush of water from the exit shall fall upon its
blades; then a source of power is obviously the
result.</p>

<p>At present, however, such a contrivance would
naturally find no advocates, for of course the commercial
aspect of the question is that which will
decide whether the scheme is practicable and
economical. The issue indeed can be very simply
stated. Suppose that a given quantity of power be
required&mdash;let us say that of one hundred horse. Then
we have to consider the conditions under which a
contrivance of the kind we have sketched shall yield
a power of this amount. Sir William Thomson,
in a very interesting address to the British Association
at York in 1881, discussed this question,
and I shall here make use of the facts he brought
forward on that occasion. He showed that to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
obtain as much power as could be produced by a
steam-engine of one hundred horse power, a very
large reservoir would be required. It is doubtful
indeed whether there would be many localities on
the earth which would be suitable for the purpose.
Suppose, however, an estuary could be found
which had an area of forty acres; then if a wall
were thrown across the mouth so that the tide
could be impounded, the total amount of power
that could be yielded by a water-wheel worked by
the incessant influx and efflux of the tide would be
equal to that yielded by the one hundred horse
engine, running continuously from one end of the
year to the other.</p>

<p>There are many drawbacks to a tide-mill of
this description. In the first place, its situation
would naturally be far removed from other conveniences
necessary for manufacturing purposes.
Then too there is the great irregularity in the
way in which the power is rendered available. At
certain periods during the twenty-four hours the
mill would stop running, and the hours when this
happened would be constantly changing. The
inconvenience from the manufacturer's point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
view of a deficiency of power during neap tides
might not be compensated by the fact that he had
an excessive supply of power at spring-tides.
Before tide-mills could be suitable for manufacturing
purposes, some means must be found for storing
away the energy when it is redundant, and applying
it when its presence is required. We should
want in fact for great sources of energy some contrivance
which shall fulfil the same purpose as the
accumulators do in an electrical installation.</p>

<p>Even then, however, the financial consideration
remains, as to whether the cost of building the dam
and maintaining the tide-mill in good order will
not on the whole exceed the original price and
the charges for the maintenance of a hundred
horse power steam-engine. There cannot be a
doubt that in this epoch of the earth's history,
so long as the price of coal is only a few shillings a
ton, the tide-mill, even though we seem to get its
power without current expense, is vastly more expensive
than a steam-engine. Indeed, Sir William
Thomson remarks, that wherever a suitable tidal
basin could be found, it would be nearly as easy to
reclaim the land altogether from the sea. And if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
this were in any locality where manufactures were
possible, the commercial value of forty acres of reclaimed
land would greatly exceed all the expenses
attending the steam-engine. But when the time
comes, as come it apparently will, that the price of
coal shall have risen to several pounds a ton, the
economical aspect of steam as compared with other
prime movers will be greatly altered; it will then
no doubt be found advantageous to utilize great
sources of energy, such as Niagara and the tides,
which it is now more prudent to let run to waste.</p>

<p>For my argument, however, it matters little that
the tides are not constrained to do much useful
work. They are always doing work of some kind,
whether that be merely heating the particles of
water by friction, or vaguely transporting sand
from one part of the ocean to the other. Useful
work or useless work are alike for the purpose of
my argument. We know that work can never be
done unless by the consumption or transformation
of energy. For each unit of work that is done&mdash;whether
by any machine or contrivance, by the
muscles of man or any other animal, by the winds,
the waves, or the tides, or in any other way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
whatever&mdash;a certain equivalent quantity of energy
must have been expended. When, therefore, we
see any work being performed, we may always look
for the source of energy to which the machine owes
its efficiency. In fact, it is the old story illustrated,
that perpetual motion is impossible. A mechanical
device, however ingenious may be the construction,
or however accurate the workmanship, can never
possess what is called perpetual motion. It is
needless to enter into details of any proposed contrivance
of wheels, of pumps, of pulleys; it is
sufficient to say that nothing in the shape of mechanism
can work without friction, that friction
produces heat, that heat is a form of energy, and
that to replace the energy consumed in producing
the heat there must be some source from which
the machine is replenished if its motion is to be
continued indefinitely.</p>

<p>Hence, as the tides may be regarded as a machine
doing work, we have to ascertain the origin of that
energy which they are continually expending. It
is at this point that we first begin to feel the difficulties
inherent in the theory of tidal evolution. I
do not mean difficulties in the sense of doubts, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
up to the present I have mentioned no doubtful
point. When I come to such I shall give due
warning. By difficulties I now mean points which
it is not easy to understand without a little dynamical
theory; but we must face these difficulties,
and endeavour to elucidate them as well as we
can.</p>

<p>Let us first see what the sources of energy can
possibly be on which the tides are permitted to
draw. Our course is simplified by the fact that
the energy of which we have to speak is of a
mechanical description, that is to say, not involving
heat or other more obscure forms of
energy. A simple type of energy is that possessed
by a clock-weight after the clock has been
wound. A store of power is thus laid up which
is gradually doled out during the week in small
quantities, second by second, to sustain the
motion of the pendulum. The energy in this case
is due to the fact that the weight is attracted by
the earth, and is yielded according as the weight
sinks downwards. In the separation between two
mutually attracting bodies, a store of energy is
thus implied. What we learn from an ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
clock may be extended to the great bodies of the
universe. The moon is a gigantic globe separated
from our earth by a distance of 240,000 miles.
The attraction between these two bodies always
tends to bring them together. No doubt the
moon is not falling towards the earth as the descending
clock-weight is doing. We may, in fact,
consider the moon, so far as our present object is
concerned, to be revolving almost in a circle, of
which the earth is the centre. If the moon, however,
were to be stopped, it would at once commence
to rush down towards the earth, whither it
would arrive with an awful crash in the course of
four or five days. It is fortunately true that the
moon does not behave thus; but it has the ability
of doing so, and thus the mere separation between
the earth and the moon involves the existence of
a stupendous quantity of energy, capable under
certain conditions of undergoing transformation.</p>

<p>There is also another source of mechanical energy
besides that we have just referred to. A rapidly
moving body possesses, in virtue of its motion, a
store of readily available energy, and it is easy to
show that energy of this type is capable of transformation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
into other types. Think of a cannon-ball
rushing through the air at a speed of a thousand
feet per second; it is capable of wreaking disaster
on anything which it meets, simply because its
rapid motion is the vehicle by which the energy
of the gunpowder is transferred from the gun to
where the blow is to be struck. Had the cannon
been directed vertically upwards, then the projectile,
leaving the muzzle with the same initial
velocity as before, would soar up and up, with
gradually abating speed, until at last it reached a
turning-point, the elevation of which would depend
upon the initial velocity. Poised for a moment at
the summit, the cannon-ball may then be likened
to the clock-weight, for the entire energy which
it possessed by its motion has been transformed
into the statical energy of a raised weight. Thus
we see these two forms of energy are mutually
interchangeable. The raised weight if allowed to
fall will acquire velocity, or the rapidly moving
weight if directed upwards will acquire altitude.</p>

<p>The quantity of energy which can be conveyed
by a rapidly moving body increases greatly with
its speed. For instance, if the speed of the body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
be doubled, the energy will be increased fourfold,
or, in general, the energy which a moving body
possesses may be said to be proportional to the
square of its speed. Here then we have another
source of the energy present in our earth-moon
system; for the moon is hurrying along in its
path with a speed of two-thirds of a mile per
second, or about twice or three times the speed of
a cannon-shot. Hence the fact that the moon
is continuously revolving in a circle shows us that
it possesses a store of energy which is nine times
as great as that which a cannon-ball as massive
as the moon, and fired with the ordinary velocity,
would receive from the powder which discharged it.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the moon is endowed with
two sources of energy, one of which is due to its
separation from the earth, and the other to the
speed of its motion. Though these are distinct,
they are connected together by a link which it is
important for us to comprehend. The speed with
which the moon revolves around the earth is connected
with the moon's distance from the earth.
The moon might, for instance, revolve in a larger
circle than that which it actually pursues; but if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
it did so, the speed of its motion would have to be
appropriately lessened. The orbit of the moon
might have a much smaller radius than it has at
present, provided that the speed was sufficiently
increased to compensate for the increased attraction
which the earth would exercise at the
lessened distance. Indeed, I am here only stating
what every one is familiar with under the form of
Kepler's Law, that the square of the periodic time
is in proportion to the cube of the mean distance.
To each distance of the moon therefore belongs an
appropriate speed. The energy due to the moon's
position and the energy due to its motion are
therefore connected together. One of these quantities
cannot be altered without the other undergoing
change. If the moon's orbit were increased
there would be a gain of energy due to the
enlarged distance, and a loss of energy due to the
diminished speed. These would not, however,
exactly compensate. On the whole, we may
represent the total energy of the moon as a single
quantity, which increases when the distance of
the moon from the earth increases, and lessens
when the distance from the earth to the moon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
lessens. For simplicity we may speak of this as
moon-energy.</p>

<p>But the most important constituent of the store
of energy in the earth-moon system is that contributed
by the earth itself. I do not now speak
of the energy due to the velocity of the earth in
its orbit round the sun. The moon indeed participates
in this equally with the earth, but it does
not affect those mutual actions between the earth
and moon with which we are at present concerned.
We are, in fact, discussing the action of that piece
of machinery the earth-moon system; and its
action is not affected by the circumstance that
the entire machine is being bodily transported
around the sun in a great annual voyage. This
has little more to do with the action of our present
argument than has the fact that a man is walking
about to do with the motions of the works of the
watch in his pocket. We shall, however, have to
allude to this subject further on.</p>

<p>The energy of the earth which is significant in
the earth-moon theory is due to the earth's rotation
upon its axis. We may here again use as
an illustration the action of machinery; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
special contrivance that I now refer to is the
punching-engine that is used in our ship-building
works. In preparing a plate of iron to be riveted
to the side of a ship, a number of holes have to be
made all round the margin of the plate. These
holes must be half an inch or more in diameter,
and the plate is sometimes as much as, or more
than, half an inch in thickness. The holes are produced
in the metal by forcing a steel punch through
it; and this is accomplished without even heating
the plate so as to soften the iron. It is needless to
say that an intense force must be applied to the
punch. On the other hand, the distance through
which the punch has to be moved is comparatively
small. The punch is attached to the end of a
powerful lever, the other end of the lever is raised
by a cam, so as to depress the punch to do its
work. An essential part of the machine is a small
but heavy fly-wheel connected by gearing with
the cam.</p>

<p>This fly-wheel when rapidly revolving contains
within it, in virtue of its motion, a large store of
energy which has gradually accumulated during
the time that the punch is not actually in action.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The energy is no doubt originally supplied from
a steam-engine. What we are especially concerned
with is the action of the rapidly rotating wheel as
a reservoir in which a large store of energy can be
conveniently maintained until such time as it is
wanted. In the action of punching, when the
steel die comes down upon the surface of the plate,
a large quantity of energy is suddenly demanded
to force the punch against the intense resistance
it experiences; the energy for this purpose is drawn
from the store in the fly-wheel, which experiences
no doubt a check in its velocity, to be regained
again from the energy of the engine during
the interval which elapses before the punch is
called on to make the next hole.</p>

<p>Another illustration of the fly-wheel on a splendid
scale is seen in our mighty steel works, where
ponderous rails are being manufactured. A white-hot
ingot of steel is presented to a pair of powerful
rollers, which grip the steel, and send it through
at the other side both compressed and elongated.
Tremendous power is required to meet the sudden
demand on the machine at the critical moment.
To obtain this power an engine of stupendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
proportions is sometimes attached directly to the
rollers, but more frequently an engine of rather less
horse-power will be used, the might of this engine
being applied to giving rapid rotation to an immense
fly-wheel, which may thus be regarded as
a reservoir full of energy. The rolling mills then
obtain from this store in the fly-wheel whatever
energy is necessary for their gigantic task.</p>

<p>These illustrations will suffice to show how a
rapidly rotating body may contain energy in
virtue of its rotation, just as a cannon-ball contains
energy in virtue of its speed of translation, or as
a clock-weight has energy in virtue of the fact
that it has some distance to fall before it reaches
the earth. The rotating body need not necessarily
have the shape of a wheel&mdash;it may be globular in
form; nor need the axes of rotation be fixed in
bearings, like those of the fly-wheel; nor of course
is there any limit to the dimensions which the
rotating body may assume. Our earth is, in fact,
a vast rotating body 8000 miles in diameter, and
turning round upon its axis once every twenty-three
hours and fifty-six minutes. Viewed in this
way, the earth is to be regarded as a gigantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
fly-wheel containing a quantity of energy great in
correspondence with the earth's mass. The amount
of energy which can be stored by rotation also
depends upon the square of the velocity with
which the body turns round; thus if our earth
turned round in half the time which it does at
present, that is, if the day was twelve hours instead
of twenty-four hours, the energy contained in
virtue of that rotation would be four times its
present amount.</p>

<p>Reverting now to the earth-moon system, the
energy which that system contains consists essentially
of two parts&mdash;the moon-energy, whose composite
character I have already explained, and the
earth-energy, which has its origin solely in the
rotation of the earth on its axis. It is necessary
to observe that these are essentially distinct&mdash;there
is no necessary relation between the speed of
the earth's rotation and the distance of the moon,
such as there is between the distance of the moon
and the speed with which it revolves in its orbit.</p>

<p>For completeness, it ought to be added that
there is also some energy due to the moon's rotation
on its axis, but this is very small for two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
reasons: first, because the moon is small compared
with the earth, and second, because the angular
velocity of the moon is also very small compared
with that of the earth. We may therefore dismiss
as insignificant the contributions from this source
of energy to the sum total.</p>

<p>I have frequently used illustrations derived from
machinery, but I want now to emphasize the
profound distinction that exists between the rotation
of the earth and the rotation of a fly-wheel in
a machine shop. They are both, no doubt, energy-holders,
but it must be borne in mind, that as the
fly-wheel doles out its energy to supply the wants
of the machines with which it is connected, a restitution
of its store is continually going on by the
action of the engine, so that on the whole the
speed of the fly-wheel does not slacken. The
earth, however, must be likened to a fly-wheel
which has been disconnected with the engine. If,
therefore, the earth have to supply certain demands
on its accumulation of energy, it can only do so
by a diminution of its hoard, and this involves a
sacrifice of some of its speed.</p>

<p>In the earth-moon system there is no engine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
at hand to restore the losses of energy which are
inevitable when work has to be done. But we have
seen that work is done; we have shown, in fact,
that the tides are at present doing work, and have
been doing work for as long a period in the
past as our imagination can extend to. The
energy which this work has necessitated can only
have been drawn from the existing store in the
system; that energy consists of two parts&mdash;the
moon-energy and the earth's rotation energy. The
problem therefore for us to consider is, which of
these two banks the tides have drawn on to meet
their constant expenditure. This is not a question
that can be decided offhand; in fact, if we attempt
to decide it in an offhand manner we shall
certainly go wrong. It seems so very plausible
to say that as the moon causes the tides, therefore
the energy which these tides expend should be
contributed by the moon. But this is not the case.
It actually happens that though the moon does
cause the tides, yet when those tides consume
energy they draw it not from the distant moon,
but from the vast supply which they find ready
to their hand, stored up in the rotation of the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The demonstration of this is not a very simple
matter; in fact, it is so far from being simple that
many philosophers, including some eminent ones
too, while admitting that of course the tides must
have drawn their energy from one or other or both
of these two sources, yet found themselves unable
to assign how the demand was distributed between
the two conceivable sources of supply.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Professor Purser of Belfast
for having indicated the true dynamical principle
on which the problem depends. It involves
reasoning based simply on the laws of motion and
on elementary mathematics, but not in the least
involving questions of astronomical observation.
It would be impossible for me in a lecture like
this to give any explanation of the mathematical
principles referred to. I shall, however, endeavour
by some illustrations to set before you what this
profound principle really is. Were I to give it the
old name I should call it the law of the conservation
of areas; the more modern writers, however,
speak of it as the conservation of moment of momentum,
an expression which exhibits the nature
of the principle in a more definite manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not see how to give any very accurate
illustration of what this law means, but I must
make the attempt, and if you think the illustration
beneath the dignity of the subject, I can only
plead the difficulty of mathematics as an excuse.
Let us suppose that a ball-room is fairly filled
with dancers, or those willing to dance, and that
a merry waltz is being played; the couples have
formed, and the floor is occupied with pairs who
are whirling round and round in that delightful
amusement. Some couples drop out for a while
and others strike in; the fewer couples there are
the wider is the range around which they can
waltz, the more numerous the couples the less
individual range will they possess. I want you to
realize that in the progress of the dance there is
a certain total quantity of spin at any moment
in progress; this spin is partly made up of the
rotation by which each dancer revolves round his
partner, and partly of the circular orbit about the
room which each couple endeavours to describe.
If there are too many couples on the floor for the
general enjoyment of the dance, then both the orbit
and the angular velocity of each couple will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
restricted by the interference with their neighbours.
We may, however, assert that so long as the dance
is in full swing the total quantity of spin, partly
rotational and partly orbital, will remain constant.
When there are but few couples the unimpeded
rotation and the large orbits will produce as much
spin as when there is a much larger number of
couples, for in the latter case the diminished
freedom will lessen the quantity of spin produced
by each individual pair. It will sometimes happen
too that collision will take place, but the slight
diversions thus arising only increase the general
merriment, so that the total quantity of spin may
be sustained, even though one or two couples
are placed temporarily <i>hors de combat</i>. I have
invoked a ball-room for the purpose of bringing
out what we may call the law of the conservation
of spin. No matter how much the individual performers
may change, or no matter what vicissitudes
arise from their collision and other mutual
actions, yet the total quantity of spin remains
unchanged.</p>

<p>Let us look at the earth-moon system. The
law of the conservation of moment of momentum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
may, with sufficient accuracy for our present
purpose, be interpreted to mean that the total
quantity of spin in the system remains unaltered.
In our system the spin is threefold; there is
first the rotation of the earth on its axis, there is
the rotation of the moon on its axis, and then
there is the orbital revolution of the moon around
the earth. The law to which we refer asserts that
the total quantity of these three spins, each
estimated in the proper way, will remain constant.
It matters not that tides may ebb and flow, or that
the distribution of the spin shall vary, but its total
amount remains inflexibly constant. One constituent
of the total amount&mdash;that is, the rotation
of the moon on its axis&mdash;is so insignificant, that
for our present purposes it may be entirely disregarded.
We may therefore assert that the amount
of spin in the earth, due to its rotation round its
axis, added to the amount of spin in the moon
due to its revolution round the earth, remains
unalterable. If one of these quantities change by
increase or by decrease, the other must correspondingly
change by decrease or by increase. If, therefore,
from any cause, the earth began to spin a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
more quickly round its axis, the moon must do a
little less spin; and consequently, it must shorten
its distance from the earth. Or suppose that the
earth's velocity of rotation is abated, then its contribution
to the total amount of spin is lessened;
the deficiency must therefore be made up by the
moon, but this can only be done by an enlargement
of the moon's orbit. I should add, as a
caution, that these results are true only on the
supposition that the earth-moon system is isolated
from all external interference. With this proviso,
however, it matters not what may happen to the
earth or moon, or what influence one of them may
exert upon the other, no matter what tides may
be raised, no matter even if the earth fly into
fragments, the whole quantity of spin of all those
fragments would, if added to the spin of the
moon, yield the same unalterable total. We are
here in possession of a most valuable dynamical
principle. We are not concerned with any special
theory as to the action of the tides; it is sufficient
for us that in some way or other the tides have
been caused by the moon, and that being so, the
principle of the conservation of spin will apply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Were the earth and the moon both rigid bodies,
then there could be of course no tides on the
earth, it being rigid and devoid of ocean. The
rotation of the earth on its axis would therefore
be absolutely without change, and therefore the
necessary condition of the conservation of spin
would be very simply attained by the fact that
neither of the constituent parts changed. The
earth, however, not being entirely rigid, and being
subject to tides, this simple state of things cannot
continue; there must be some change in progress.</p>

<p>I have already shown that the fact of the
ebbing and the flowing of the tide necessitates an
expenditure of energy, and we saw that this energy
must come either from that stored up in the earth
by its rotation, or from that possessed by the
moon in virtue of its distance and revolution. The
law of the conservation of spin will enable us to
decide at once as to whence the tides get their
energy. Suppose they took it from the moon, the
moon would then lose in energy, and consequently
come nearer the earth. The quantity of spin contributed
by the moon would therefore be lessened,
and accordingly the spin to be made up by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
earth would be increased. That means, of course,
that the velocity of the earth rotating on its axis
must be increased, and this again would necessitate
an increase in the earth's rotational energy.
It can be shown, too, that to keep the total spin
right, the energy of the earth would have to gain
more than the moon would have lost by revolving
in a smaller orbit. Thus we find that the total
quantity of energy in the system would be increased.
This would lead to the absurd result that the action
of the tides manufactured energy in our system.
Of course, such a doctrine cannot be true; it would
amount to a perpetual motion! We might as
well try to get a steam-engine which would produce
enough heat by friction not only to supply
its own boilers, but to satisfy all the thermal
wants of the whole parish. We must therefore
adopt the other alternative. The tides do not
draw their energy from the moon; they draw it
from the store possessed by the earth in virtue
of its rotation.</p>

<p>We can now state the end of this rather long
discussion in a very simple and brief manner.
Energy can only be yielded by the earth at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
expense of some of the speed of its rotation. The
tides must therefore cause the earth to revolve
more slowly; in other words, <i>the tides are increasing
the length of the day</i>.</p>

<p>The earth therefore loses some of its velocity
of rotation; consequently it does less than its due
share of the total quantity of spin, and an increased
quantity of spin must therefore be accomplished
by the moon; but this can only be done by an
enlargement of its orbit. Thus there are two great
consequences of the tides in the earth-moon system&mdash;the
days are getting longer, the moon is receding
further.</p>

<p>These points are so important that I shall try
and illustrate them in another way, which will
show, at all events, that one and both of these tidal
phenomena commend themselves to our common
sense. Have we not shown how the tides in their
ebb and flow are incessantly producing friction,
and have we not also likened the earth to a great
wheel? When the driver wants to stop a railway
train the brakes are put on, and the brake is merely
a contrivance for applying friction to the circumference
of a wheel for the purpose of checking its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
motion. Or when a great weight is being lowered
by a crane, the motion is checked by a band which
applies friction on the circumference of a wheel,
arranged for the special purpose. Need we then
be surprised that the friction of the tides acts like
a brake on the earth, and gradually tends to check
its mighty rotation? The progress of lengthening
the day by the tides is thus readily intelligible. It
is not quite so easy to see why the ebbing and the
flowing of the tide on the earth should actually
have the effect of making the moon to retreat; this
phenomenon is in deference to a profound law of
nature, which tells us that action and reaction are
equal and opposite to each other. If I might
venture on a very homely illustration, I may say
that the moon, like a troublesome fellow, is constantly
annoying the earth by dragging its waters
backward and forward by means of tides; and the
earth, to free itself from this irritating interference,
tries to push off the aggressor and to make him

<p>Another way in which we can illustrate the
retreat of the moon as the inevitable consequence
of tidal friction is shown in the adjoining figure, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which the large body
E represents the earth,
and the small body M
the moon. We may for
simplicity regard the
moon as a point, and
as this attracts each
particle of the earth,
the total effect of the
moon on the earth may
be represented by a
single force. By the
law of equality of action
and reaction, the force
of the earth on the
moon is to be represented
by an equal and
opposite force. If there
were no tides then the
moon's force would of
course pass through the
earth's centre; but as the effect of the moon is to
slacken the earth's rotation, it follows that the total
force does not exactly pass through the line of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
earth's centre, but a little to one side, in order to
pull the opposite way to that in which the earth
is turning, and thus bring down its speed. We
may therefore decompose the earth's total force
on the moon into two parts, one of which tends
directly towards the earth's centre, while the other
acts tangentially to the moon's orbit. The central
force is of course the main guiding power which
keeps the moon in its path; but the incessant
tangential force constantly tends to send the moon
out further and further, and thus the growth of its
orbit can be accounted for.</p>

<p>We therefore conclude finally, that the tides are
making the day longer and sending the moon away
further. It is the development of the consequences
of these laws that specially demands our attention
in these lectures. We must have the courage to
look at the facts unflinchingly, and deduce from
them all the wondrous consequences they involve.
Their potency arises from a characteristic feature&mdash;they
are unintermitting. Most of the great
astronomical changes with which we are ordinarily
familiar are really periodic: they gradually increase
in one direction for years, for centuries, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for untold ages; but then a change comes, and the
increase is changed into a decrease, so that after
the lapse of becoming periods the original state
of things is restored. Such periodic phenomena
abound in astronomy. There is the annual fluctuation
of the seasons; there is the eighteen or nineteen
year period of the moon; there is the great
period of the precession of the equinoxes, amounting
to twenty-six thousand years; and then there
is the stupendous Annus Magnus of hundreds of
thousands of years, during which the earth's orbit
itself breathes in and out in response to the attraction
of the planets. But these periodic phenomena,
however important they may be to us mere
creatures of a day, are insignificant in their effects
on the grand evolution through which the celestial
bodies are passing. The really potent agents in
fashioning the universe are those which, however
slow or feeble they may seem to be, are still
incessant in their action. The effect which a cause
shall be competent to produce depends not alone
upon the intensity of that cause, but also upon
the time during which it has been in operation.
From the phenomena of geology, as well as from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
those of astronomy, we know that this earth and
the system to which it belongs has endured for
ages, not to be counted by scores of thousands of
years, or, as Prof. Tyndall has so well remarked,
&#8220;Not for six thousand years, nor for sixty thousand
years, nor six hundred thousand years, but for
&aelig;ons of untold millions.&#8221; Those slender agents
which have devoted themselves unceasingly to
the accomplishment of a single task may in this
long lapse of time have accomplished results
of stupendous magnitude. In famed stalactite
caverns we are shown a colossal figure of crystal
extending from floor to roof, and the formation
of that column is accounted for when we see a
tiny drop falling from the roof above to the floor
beneath. A lifetime may not suffice for that falling
drop to add an appreciable increase to the stalactite
down which it trickles, or to the growing stalagmite
on which it falls; but when the operation has been
in progress for immense ages, it is capable of the
formation of the stately column. Here we have an
illustration of an influence which, though apparently
trivial, acquires colossal significance when adequate
time is afforded. It is phenomena of this kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which the student of nature should most narrowly
watch, for they are the real architects of the
universe.</p>

<p>The tidal consequences which we have already
demonstrated are emphatically of this non-periodic
class&mdash;the day is always lengthening, the
moon is always retreating. To-day is longer than
yesterday; to-morrow will be longer than to-day.
It cannot be said that the change is a great one;
it is indeed too small to be appreciable even by
our most delicate observations. In one thousand
years the alteration in the length of a day is only
a small fraction of a second; but what may be a
very small matter in one thousand years can become
a very large one in many millions of years.
Thus it is that when we stretch our view through
immense vistas of time past, or when we look forward
through immeasurable ages of time to come,
the alteration in the length of the day will assume
the most startling proportions, and involve the
most momentous consequences.</p>

<p>Let us first look back. There was a time when
the day, instead of being the twenty-four hours we
now have, must have been only twenty-three hours,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
How many millions of years ago that was I do
not pretend to say, nor is the point material for
our argument; suffice it to say, that assuming, as
geology assures us we may assume, the existence
of these &aelig;ons of millions of years, there was once
a time when the day was not only one hour
shorter, but was even several hours less than it is
at present. Nor need we stop our retrospect at a
day of even twenty, or fifteen, or ten hours
long; we shall at once project our glance back to
an immeasurably remote epoch, at which the earth
was spinning round in a time only one sixth or
even less of the length of the present day. There
is here a reason for our retrospect to halt, for at
some eventful period, when the day was about
three or four hours long, the earth must have been
in a condition of a very critical kind.</p>

<p>It is well known that fearful accidents occasionally
happen where large grindstones are being
driven at a high speed. The velocity of rotation
becomes too great for the tenacity of the stone to
withstand the stress; a rupture takes place, the
stone flies in pieces, and huge fragments are
hurled around. For each particular grindstone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
there is a certain special velocity depending upon
its actual materials and character, at which it would
inevitably fly in pieces. I have once before likened
our earth to a wheel; now let me liken it to a
grindstone. There is therefore a certain critical
velocity of rotation for the earth at which it would
be on the brink of rupture. We cannot exactly
say, in our ignorance of the internal constitution
of the earth, what length of day would be the
shortest possible for our earth to have consistently
with the preservation of its integrity; we may,
however, assume that it will be about three or four
hours, or perhaps a little less than three. The exact
amount, however, is not really very material to us;
it would be sufficient for our argument to assert
that there is a certain minimum length of day for
which the earth can hold together. In our retrospect,
therefore, through the abyss of time past our
view must be bounded by that state of the earth
when it is revolving in this critical period. With
what happened before that we shall not at present
concern ourselves. Thus we look back to a time at
the beginning of the present order of things, when
the day was only some three or four hours long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now look at the moon, and examine
where it must have been during these past ages.
As the moon is gradually getting further and further
from us at present, so, looking back into past
time, we find that the moon was nearer and nearer
to the earth the further back our view extends;
in fact, concentrating our attention solely on essential
features, we may say that the path of the
moon is a sort of spiral which winds round and
round the earth, gradually getting larger, though
with extreme slowness. Looking back we see this
spiral gradually coiling in and in, until in a retrospect
of millions of years, instead of its distance
from the earth being 240,000 miles, it must have
been much less. There was a time when the
moon was only 200,000 miles away; there was
a time many millions of years ago, when the moon
was only 100,000 miles away. Nor can we here
stop our retrospect; we must look further and
further back, and follow the moon's spiral path as
it creeps in and in towards the earth, until at last
it appears actually in contact with that great globe
of ours, from which it is now separated by a quarter
of a million of miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely the tides have thus led us to the knowledge
of an astounding epoch in our earth's past
history, when the earth is spinning round in a few
hours, and when the moon is, practically speaking,
in contact with it. Perhaps I should rather say,
that the materials of our present moon were in this
situation, for we would hardly be entitled to assume
that the moon then possessed the same globular
form in which we see it now. To form a just
apprehension of the true nature of both bodies at
this critical epoch, we must study their concurrent
history as it is disclosed to us by a totally different
line of reasoning.</p>

<p>Drop, then, for a moment all thought of tides,
and let us bring to our aid the laws of heat, which
will disclose certain facts in the ancient history
of the earth-moon system perhaps as astounding
as those to which the tides have conducted us.
In one respect we may compare these laws of heat
with the laws of the tides; they are both alike
non-periodic, their effects are cumulative from age
to age, and imagination can hardly even impose
a limit to the magnificence of the works they can
accomplish. Our argument from heat is founded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
on a very simple matter. It is quite obvious that
a heated body tends to grow cold. I am not now
speaking of fires or of actual combustion whereby
heat is produced; I am speaking merely of such
heat as would be possessed by a red-hot poker
after being taken from the fire, or by an iron casting
after the metal has been run into the mould. In
such cases as this the general law holds good,
that the heated body tends to grow cold. The
cooling may be retarded no doubt if the passage
of heat from the body is impeded. We can, for
instance, retard the cooling of a teapot by the
well-known practice of putting a cosy upon it; but
the law remains that, slowly or quickly, the heated
body will tend to grow colder. It seems almost
puerile to insist with any emphasis on a point so
obvious as this, but yet I frequently find that
people do not readily apprehend all the gigantic
consequences that can flow from a principle so
simple. It is true that a poker cools when taken
from the fire; we also find that a gigantic casting
weighing many tons will grow gradually cold,
though it may require days to do so. The same
principle will extend to any object, no matter how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
vast it may happen to be. Were that great casting
2000 miles in diameter, or were it 8000 miles in
diameter, it will still steadily part with its heat,
though no doubt the process of cooling becomes
greatly prolonged with an increase in the dimensions
of the heated body. The earth and the moon
cannot escape from the application of these simple
principles.</p>

<p>Let us first speak of the earth. There are
multitudes of volcanoes in action at the present
moment in various countries upon this earth. Now
whatever explanation may be given of the approximate
cause of the volcanic phenomena, there
can be no doubt that they indicate the existence
of heat in the interior of the earth. It may
possibly be, as some have urged, that the volcanoes
are merely vents for comparatively small masses
of subterranean molten matter; it may be, as
others more reasonably, in my opinion, believe, that
the whole interior of the earth is at the temperature
of incandescence, and that the eruptions of
volcanoes and the shocks of earthquakes are merely
consequences of the gradual shrinkage of the
external crust, as it continually strives to accommodate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
itself to the lessening bulk of the fluid
interior. But whichever view we may adopt, it is
at least obvious that the earth is in part, at all
events, a heated body, and that the heat is not in
the nature of a combustion, generated and sustained
by the progress of chemical action. No doubt there
may be local phenomena of this description, but
by far the larger proportion of the earth's internal
heat seems merely the fervour of incandescence. It
is to be likened to the heat of the molten iron
which has been run into the sand, rather than to
the glowing coals in the furnace in which that iron
has been smelted.</p>

<p>There is one volcanic outbreak of such exceptional
interest in these modern times that I cannot
refrain from alluding to it. Doubtless every one
has heard of that marvellous eruption of Krakatoa,
which occurred on August 26th and 27th, 1883,
and gives a unique chapter in the history of
volcanic phenomena. Not alone was the eruption
of Krakatoa alarming in its more ordinary manifestations,
but it was unparalleled both in the
vehemence of the shock and in the distance to
which the effects of the great eruption were propagated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
I speak not now of the great waves of ocean
that inundated the coasts of Sumatra and Java,
and swept away thirty-six thousand people, nor do
I allude to the intense darkness which spread for
one hundred and eighty miles or more all round.
I shall just mention the three most important
phenomena, which demonstrate the energy which
still resides in the interior of our earth. Place a
terrestrial globe before you, and fix your attention
on the Straits of Sunda; think also of the great
atmospheric ocean some two or three hundred
miles deep which envelopes our earth. When a
pebble is tossed into a pond a beautiful series of
concentric ripples diverge from it; so when Krakatoa
burst up in that mighty catastrophe, a series
of gigantic waves were propagated through the
air; they embraced the whole globe, converged to
the antipodes of Krakatoa, thence again diverged,
and returned to the seat of the volcano; a second
time the mighty series of atmospheric ripples
spread to the antipodes, and a second time returned.
Seven times did that series of waves course over
our globe, and leave their traces on every self-recording
barometer that our earth possesses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Thirty-six hours were occupied in the journey of
the great undulation from Krakatoa to its antipodes.
Perhaps even more striking was the extent
of our earth's surface over which the noise of the
great explosion spread. At Batavia, ninety-four
miles away, the concussions were simply deafening;
at Macassar, in Celebes, two steamers were
sent out to investigate the explosions which were
heard, little thinking that they came from Krakatoa,
nine hundred and sixty-nine miles away.
Alarming sounds were heard over the island of
Timor, one thousand three hundred and fifty-one
miles away from Krakatoa. Diego Garcia in the
Chogos islands is two thousand two hundred and
sixty-seven miles from Krakatoa, but the thunders
traversed even this distance, and were attributed
to some ship in distress, for which a search was
made. Most astounding of all, there is undoubted
evidence that the sound of the mighty explosion
was propagated across nearly the entire Indian
ocean, and was heard in the island of Rodriguez,
almost three thousand miles away. The immense
distance over which this sound journeyed
will be appreciated by the fact, that the noise did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
not reach Rodriguez until four hours after it had
left Krakatoa. In fact, it would seem that if
Vesuvius were to explode with the same vehemence
as Krakatoa did, the thunders of the
explosion might penetrate so far as to be heard
in London.</p>

<p>There is another and more beautiful manifestation
of the world-wide significance of the
Krakatoa outbreak. The vast column of smoke
and ashes ascended twenty miles high in the
air, and commenced a series of voyages around
the equatorial regions of the earth. In three days
it crossed the Indian ocean, and was traversing
equatorial Africa; then came an Atlantic voyage;
and then it coursed over central America, before
a Pacific voyage brought it back to its point of
departure after thirteen days; then the dust started
again, and was traced around another similar
circuit, while it was even tracked for a considerable
time in placing the third girdle round the earth.
Strange blue suns and green moons and other
mysterious phenomena marked the progress of this
vast volcanic cloud. At last the cloud began to
lose its density, the dust spread more widely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
over the tropics, became diffused through the
temperate regions, and then the whole earth was
able to participate in the glories of Krakatoa.
The marvellous sunsets in the autumn of 1883
are attributable to this cause; and thus once again
was brought before us the fact that the earth
still contains large stores of thermal energy.</p>

<p>Attempts are sometimes made to explain volcanic
phenomena on the supposition that they are
entirely of a local character, and that we are not
entitled to infer the incandescent nature of the
earth's interior from the fact that volcanic outbreaks
occasionally happen. For our present purpose
this point is immaterial, though I must say
it appears to me unreasonable to deny that the
interior of the earth is in a most highly heated
state. Every test we can apply shows us the
existence of internal heat. Setting aside the more
colossal phenomena of volcanic eruptions, we have
innumerable minor manifestations of its presence.
Are there not geysers and hot springs in many
parts of the earth? and have we not all over our
globe invariable testimony confirming the statement,
that the deeper we go down beneath its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
surface the hotter does the temperature become?
Every miner is familiar with these facts; he knows
that the deeper are his shafts the warmer it is
down below, and the greater the necessity for providing
increased ventilation to keep the temperature
within a limit that shall be suitable for the
workmen. All these varied classes of phenomena
admit solely of one explanation, and that is, that
the interior of the earth contains vast stores of
incandescent heat.</p>

<p>We now apply to our earth the same reasoning
which we should employ on a poker taken from the
fire, or on a casting drawn from the foundry. Such
bodies will lose their heat by radiation and conduction.
The earth is therefore losing its heat. No doubt
the process is an extremely slow one. The mighty
reservoirs of internal heat are covered by vast
layers of rock, which are such excellent non-conductors
that they offer every possible impediment
to the leakage of heat from the interior to the
surface. We coat our steam-pipes over with non-conducting
material, and this can now be done so
successfully, that it is beginning to be found
economical to transmit steam for a very long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
distance through properly protected pipes. But
no non-conducting material that we can manufacture
can be half so effective as the shell of rock
twenty miles or more in thickness, which secures
the heated interior of the earth from rapid loss
by radiation into space. Even were the earth's
surface solid copper or solid silver, both most
admirable conductors of heat, the cooling down
of this vast globe would be an extremely tardy
process; how much more tardy must it therefore
be when such exceedingly bad conductors as rocks
form the envelope? How imperfectly material
of this kind will transmit heat is strikingly illustrated
by the great blast iron furnaces which are
so vitally important in one of England's greatest
manufacturing industries. A glowing mass of coal
and iron ore and limestone is here urged to vivid
incandescence by a blast of air itself heated
to an intense temperature. The mighty heat thus
generated&mdash;sufficient as it is to detach the iron
from its close alliance with the earthy materials
and to render the metal out as a pure stream
rushing white-hot from the vent&mdash;is sufficiently
confined by a few feet of brick-work, one side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
which is therefore at the temperature of molten
iron, while the other is at a temperature not much
exceeding that of the air. We may liken the brick-work
of a blast furnace to the rocky covering of
the earth; in each case an exceedingly high temperature
on one side is compatible with a very
moderate temperature on the other.</p>

<p>Although the drainage of heat away from the
earth's interior to its surface, and its loss there by
radiation into space, is an extremely tardy process,
yet it is incessantly going on. We have here
again to note the ability for gigantic effect which
a small but continually operating cause may have,
provided it always tends in the same direction.
The earth is incessantly losing heat; and though
in a day, a week, or a year the loss may not be
very significant, yet when we come to deal with
periods of time that have to be reckoned by millions
of years, it may well be that the effect of a small
loss of heat per annum can, in the course of these
ages, reach unimagined dimensions. Suppose, for
instance, that the earth experienced a fall of temperature
in its interior which amounted to only one-thousandth
of a degree in a year. So minute a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
quantity as this is imperceptible. Even in a century,
the loss of heat at this rate would be only the tenth
of a degree. There would be no possible way of
detecting it; the most careful thermometer could
not be relied on to tell us for a certainty that the
temperature of the hot waters of Bath had declined
the tenth of a degree; and I need hardly say, that
the fall of a tenth of a degree would signify nothing
in the lavas of Vesuvius, nor influence the thunders
of Krakatoa by one appreciable note. So far
as a human life or the life of the human race
is concerned, the decline of a tenth of a degree
per century in the earth's internal heat is absolutely
void of significance. I cannot, however,
impress upon you too strongly, that the mere few
thousands of years with which human history is
cognizant are an inappreciable moment in comparison
with those unmeasured millions of years
which geology opens out to us, or with those far
more majestic periods which the astronomer demands
for the events he has to describe.</p>

<p>An annual loss of even one-thousandth of a degree
will be capable of stupendous achievements when
supposed to operate during epochs of geological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
magnitude. In fact, its effects would be so vast,
that it seems hardly credible that the present loss
of heat from the earth should be so great as to
amount to an abatement of one-thousandth of a
degree per annum, for that would mean, that in
a thousand years the earth's temperature would
decline by one degree, and in a million years the
decline would amount to a thousand degrees. At
all events, the illustration may suffice to show, that
the fact that we are not able to prove by our instruments
that the earth is cooling is no argument
whatever against the inevitable law, that the earth,
like every other heated body, must be tending
towards a lower temperature.</p>

<p>Without pretending to any numerical accuracy,
we can at all events give a qualitative if not a
quantitative analysis of the past history of our earth,
in so far as its changes of temperature are concerned.
A million years ago our earth doubtless contained
appreciably more heat than it does at present. I
speak not now, of course, of mere solar heat&mdash;of the
heat which gives us the vicissitudes of seasons; I
am only referring to the original hoard of internal
heat which is gradually waning. As therefore our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
retrospect extends through millions and millions
of past ages, we see our earth ever growing warmer
and warmer the further and further we look back.
There was a time when those heated strata which
we have now to go deep down in mines to find
were considerably nearer the surface. At present,
were it not for the sun, the heat of the earth where
we stand would hardly be appreciably above the
temperature of infinite space&mdash;perhaps some 200
or 300 degrees below zero. But there must have
been a time when there was sufficient internal heat
to maintain the exterior at a warm and indeed at
a very hot temperature. Nor is there any bound
to our retrospect arising from the operation or
intervention of any other agent, so far as we know;
consequently the hotter and the hotter grows the
surface the further and the further we look back.
Nor can we stop until, at an antiquity so great that
I do not venture on any estimate of the date, we
discover that this earth must have consisted of glowing
hot material. Further and further we can look
back, and we see the rocks&mdash;or whatever other term
we choose to apply to the then ingredients of the
earth's crust&mdash;in a white-hot and even in a molten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
condition. Thus our argument has led us to the
belief that time was when this now solid globe of
ours was a ball of white-hot fluid.</p>

<p>On the argument which I have here used there
are just two remarks which I particularly wish to
make. Note in the first place, that our reasoning
is founded on the fact that the earth is at present,
to some extent, heated. It matters not whether
this heat be much or little; our argument would
have been equally valid had the earth only contained
a single particle of its mass at a somewhat
higher temperature than the temperature
of space. I am, of course, not alluding in this to
heat which can be generated by combustion. The
other point to which I refer is to remove an objection
which may possibly be urged against this
line of reasoning. I have argued that because the
temperature is continually increasing as we look
backwards, that therefore a very great temperature
must once have prevailed. Without some explanation
this argument is not logically complete.
There is, it is well known, the old paradox of the
geometric series; you may add a farthing to a
halfpenny, and then a half-farthing, and then a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
quarter-farthing, and then the eighth of a farthing,
followed by the sixteenth, and thirty-second, and
so on, halving the contribution each time. Now
no matter how long you continue this process, even
if you went on with it for ever, and thus made an
infinite number of contributions, you would never
accomplish the task of raising the original halfpenny
to the dignity of a penny. An infinite
number of quantities may therefore, as this illustration
shows, never succeed in attaining any considerable
dimensions. Our argument, however,
with regard to the increase of heat as we look
back is the very opposite of this. It is the essence
of a cooling body to lose heat more rapidly in
proportion as its temperature is greater. Thus
though the one-thousandth of a degree may be all
the fall of temperature that our earth now experiences
in a twelvemonth, yet in those glowing days
when the surface was heated to incandescence, the
loss of heat per annum must have been immensely
greater than it is now. It therefore follows that
the rate of gain of the earth's heat as we look
back must be of a different character to that of
the geometric series which I have just illustrated;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for each addition to the earth's heat, as we look
back from year to year, must grow greater and
greater, and therefore there is here no shelter
for a fallacy in the argument on which the existence
of high temperature of primeval times is
founded.</p>

<p>The reasoning that I have applied to our earth
may be applied in almost similar words to the
moon. It is true that we have not any knowledge
of the internal nature of the moon at present, nor
are we able to point to any active volcanic
phenomena at present in progress there in support
of the contention that the moon either has
now internal heat, or did once possess it. It is,
however, impossible to deny the evidence which
the lunar craters afford as to the past existence
of volcanic activity on our satellite. Heat, therefore,
there was once in the moon; and accordingly
we are enabled to conclude that, on a retrospect
through illimitable periods of time, we must find
the moon transformed from that cold and inert
body she now seems to a glowing and incandescent
mass of molten material. The earth therefore
and the moon in some remote ages&mdash;not alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
anterior to the existence of life, but anterior even
to the earliest periods of which geologists have
cognizance&mdash;must have been both globes of molten
materials which have consolidated into the rocks
of the present epoch.</p>

<p>We must now revert to the tidal history of the
earth-moon system. Did we not show that there
was a time when the earth and the moon&mdash;or
perhaps, I should say, the ingredients of the earth
and moon&mdash;were close together, were indeed in
actual contact? We have now learned, from a
wholly different line of reasoning, that in very
early ages both bodies were highly heated. Here
as elsewhere in this theory we can make little or
no attempt to give any chronology, or to harmonize
the different lines along which the course
of history has run. No one can form the slightest
idea as to what the temperature of the earth and of
the moon must have been in those primeval ages
when they were in contact. It is impossible, however,
to deny that they must both have been in
a very highly heated state; and everything we
know of the matter inclines us to the belief that
the temperature of the earth-moon system must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at this critical epoch have been one of glowing
incandescence and fusion. It is therefore quite
possible that these bodies&mdash;the moon especially&mdash;may
have then been not at all of the form we see
them now. It has been supposed, and there are
some grounds for the supposition, that at this initial
stage of earth-moon history the moon materials
did not form a globe, but were disposed in a ring
which surrounded the earth, the ring being in a
condition of rapid rotation. It was at a subsequent
period, according to this view, that the substances
in the ring gradually drew together, and then by
their mutual attractions formed a globe which ultimately
consolidated down into the compact moon
as we now see it. I must, however, specially draw
your attention to the clearly-marked line which
divides the facts which dynamics have taught us
from those notions which are to be regarded as
more or less conjectural. Interpreting the action
of the tides by the principles of dynamics, we are
assured that the moon was once&mdash;or rather the
materials of the moon&mdash;in the immediate vicinity
of the earth. There, however, dynamics leaves us,
and unfortunately withholds its accurate illumination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
from the events which immediately preceded
that state of things.</p>

<p>The theory of tidal evolution which I am describing
in these lectures is mainly the work of
Professor George H. Darwin of Cambridge. Much
of the original parts of the theory of the tides was
due to Sir William Thomson, and I have also
mentioned how Professor Purser contributed an
important element to the dynamical theory. It
is, however, Darwin who has persistently deduced
from the theory all the various consequences which
can be legitimately drawn from it. Darwin, for
instance, pointed out that as the moon is receding
from us, it must, if we only look far enough back,
have been once in practical contact with the earth.
It is to Darwin also that we owe many of the
other parts of a fascinating theory, either in its
mathematical or astronomical aspect; but I must
take this opportunity of saying, that I do not
propose to make Professor Darwin or any of the
other mathematicians I have named responsible
for all that I shall say in these lectures. I must
be myself accountable for the way in which the
subject is being treated, as well as for many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the illustrations used, and some of the deductions
I have drawn from the subject.</p>

<p>It is almost unavoidable for us to make a surmise
as to the cause by which the moon had come
into this remarkable position close to the earth at
the most critical epoch of earth-moon history.</p>

<p>With reference to this Professor Darwin has
offered an explanation, which seems so exceedingly
plausible that it is impossible to resist the notion
that it must be correct. I will ask you to think
of the earth not as a solid body covered largely
with ocean, but as a glowing globe of molten
material. In a globe of this kind it is possible for
great undulations to be set up. Here is a large vase
of water, and by displacing it I can cause the water
to undulate with a period which depends on the
size of the vessel; undulations can be set up in a
bucket of water, the period of these undulations
being dependent upon the dimensions of the bucket.
Similarly in a vast globe of molten material certain
undulations could be set up, and those undulations
would have a period depending upon the dimensions
of this vibrating mass. We may conjecture a
mode in which such vibrations could be originated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Imagine a thin shell of rigid material which just
encases the globe; suppose this be divided into
four quarters, like the four quarters of an orange,
and that two of these opposite quarters be rejected,
leaving two quarters on the liquid. Now suppose
that these two quarters be suddenly pressed in, and
then be as suddenly removed&mdash;they will produce
depressions, of course, on the two opposite quarters,
while the uncompressed quarters will become
protuberant. In virtue of the mutual attractions
between the different particles of the mass, an
effort will be made to restore the globular form,
but this will of course rather overshoot the mark;
and therefore a series of undulations will be originated
by which two opposite quarters of the sphere
will alternately shrink in and become protuberant.
There will be a particular period to this oscillation.
For our globe it would appear to be somewhere
about an hour and a half or two hours; but there
is necessarily a good deal of uncertainty about this
point.</p>

<p>We have seen how in those primitive days the
earth was spinning around very rapidly; and I have
also stated that the earth might at this very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
critical epoch of its history be compared with a
grindstone which is being driven so rapidly that
it is on the very brink of rupture. It is remarkable
to note, that a cause tending to precipitate
a rupture of the earth was at hand. The sun then
raised tides in the earth as it does at present.
When the earth revolved in a period of some four
hours or thereabouts, the high tides caused by the
sun succeeded each other at intervals of about two
hours. When I speak of tides in this respect,
of course I am not alluding to oceanic tides;
these were the days long before ocean existed, at
least in the liquid form. The tides I am speaking
about were raised in the fluids and materials which
then constituted the whole of the glowing earth;
those tides rose and fell under the throb produced
by the sun, just as truly as tides produced in an
ordinary ocean. But now note the significant coincidence
between the period of the throb produced
by the sun-raised tides, and that natural period of
vibration which belonged to our earth as a mass
of molten material. It therefore follows, that the
impulse given to the earth by the sun harmonized
in time with that period in which the earth itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
was disposed to oscillate. A well-known dynamical
principle here comes into play. You see a heavy
weight hanging by a string, and in my hand I
hold a little slip of wood no heavier than a common
pencil; ordinarily speaking, I might strike
that heavy weight with this slip of wood, and no
effect is produced; but if I take care to time the
little blows that I give so that they shall harmonize
with the vibrations which the weight is naturally
disposed to make, then the effect of many small
blows will be cumulative, so much so, that after a
short time the weight begins to respond to my
efforts, and now you see it has acquired a swing of
very considerable amplitude. In Professor Fitzgerald's
address to the British Association at Bath
last autumn, he gives an account of those astounding
experiments of Hertz, in which well-timed
electrical impulses broke down an air resistance,
and revealed to us ethereal vibrations which could
never have been made manifest except by the
principle we are here discussing. The ingenious
conjecture has been made, that when the earth was
thrown into tidal vibrations in those primeval days,
these slight vibrations, harmonizing as they did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with the natural period of the earth, gradually
acquired amplitude; the result being that the pulse
of each successive vibration increased at last to
such an extent that the earth separated under the
stress, and threw off a portion of those semi-fluid
materials of which it was composed. In process of
time these rejected portions contracted together,
and ultimately formed that moon we now see.
Such is the origin of the moon which the modern
theory of tidal evolution has presented to our
notice.</p>

<p>There are two great epochs in the evolution of
the earth-moon system&mdash;two critical epochs which
possess a unique dynamical significance; one of
these periods was early in the beginning, while the
other cannot arrive for countless ages yet to come.
I am aware that in discussing this matter I am
entering somewhat largely into mathematical principles;
I must only endeavour to state the matter
as succinctly as the subject will admit.</p>

<p>In an earlier part of this lecture I have explained
how, during all the development of the
earth-moon system, the quantity of moment of
momentum remains unaltered. The moment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
momentum of the earth's rotation added to the
moment of momentum of the moon's revolution
remains constant; if one of these quantities increase
the other must decrease, and the progress of
the evolution will have this result, that energy shall
be gradually lost in consequence of the friction
produced by the tides. The investigation is one
appropriate for mathematical formul&aelig;, such as
those that can be found in Professor Darwin's
memoirs; but nature has in this instance dealt
kindly with us, for she has enabled an abstruse
mathematical principle to be dealt with in a singularly
clear and concise manner. We want to obtain
a definite view of the alteration in the energy of
the system which shall correspond to a small
change in the velocity of the earth's rotation, the
moon of course accommodating itself so that the
moment of momentum shall be preserved unaltered.
We can use for this purpose an angular
velocity which represents the excess of the earth's
rotation over the angular revolution of the moon;
it is, in fact, the apparent angular velocity with
which the moon appears to move round the
heavens. If we represent by N the angular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
velocity of the earth, and by M the angular
velocity of the moon in its orbit round the earth,
the quantity we desire to express is N&mdash;M;
we shall call it the relative rotation. The mathematical
theorem which tells us what we want can
be enunciated in a concise manner as follows.
<i>The alteration of the energy of the system may be
expressed by multiplying the relative rotation by the
change in the earth's angular velocity.</i> This result
will explain many points to us in the theory, but
just at present I am only going to make a single
inference from it.</p>

<p>I must advert for a moment to the familiar
conception of a maximum or a minimum. If a
magnitude be increasing, that is, gradually growing
greater and greater, it has obviously not attained
a maximum so long as the growth is in progress.
Nor if the object be actually decreasing can it be
said to be at a maximum either; for then it was
greater a second ago than it is now, and therefore
it cannot be at a maximum at present. We may
illustrate this by the familiar example of a stone
thrown up into the air; at first it gradually rises,
being higher at each instant than it was previously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
until a culminating point is reached, when just for
a moment the stone is poised at the summit of its
path ere it commences its return to earth again.
In this case the maximum point is obtained when
the stone, having ceased to ascend, and not having
yet commenced to descend, is momentarily at rest.</p>

<p>The same principles apply to the determination
of a minimum. As long as the magnitude is declining
the minimum has not been reached; it is
only when the decline has ceased, and an increase
is on the point of setting in, that the minimum
can be said to be touched.</p>

<p>The earth-moon system contains at any moment
a certain store of energy, and to every conceivable
condition of the earth-moon system a certain
quantity of energy is appropriate. It is instructive
for us to study the different positions in which
the earth and the moon might lie, and to examine
the different quantities of energy which the system
will contain in each of those varied positions. It
is however to be understood that the different
cases all presuppose the same total moment of
momentum.</p>

<p>Among the different cases that can be imagined,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
those will be of special interest in which the total
quantity of energy in the system is a maximum
or a minimum. We must for this purpose suppose
the system gradually to run through all conceivable
changes, with the earth and moon as near as
possible, and as far as possible, and in all intermediate
positions; we must also attribute to the
earth every variety in the velocity of its rotation
which is compatible with the preservation of the
moment of momentum. Beginning then with the
earth's velocity of rotation at its lowest, we may
suppose it gradually and continually increased, and,
as we have already seen, the change in the energy
of the system is to be expressed by multiplying
the relative rotation into the change of the earth's
angular velocity. It follows from the principles
we have already explained, that the maximum
or minimum energy is attained at the moment
when the alteration is zero. It therefore follows,
that the critical periods of the system will arise
when the relative rotation is zero, that is, when
the earth's rotation on its axis is performed with
a velocity equal to that with which the moon
revolves around the earth. This is truly a singular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
condition of the earth-moon system; the moon in
such a case would revolve around the earth as
if the two bodies were bound together by rigid
bonds into what was practically a single solid
body. At the present moment no doubt to some
extent this condition is realized, because the moon
always turns the same face to the earth (a point on
which we shall have something to say later on); but
in the original condition of the earth-moon system,
the earth would also constantly direct the same
face to the moon, a condition of things which is
now very far from being realized.</p>

<p>It can be shown from the mathematical nature
of the problem that there are four states of the
earth-moon system in which this condition may
be realized, and which are also compatible with
the conservation of the moment of momentum.
We can express what this condition implies in a
somewhat more simple manner. Let us understand
by the <i>day</i> the period of the earth's rotation
on its axis, whatever that may be, and let us
understand by the <i>month</i> the period of revolution
of the moon around the earth, whatever value it
may have; then the condition of maximum or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
minimum energy is attained when the day and the
month have become equal to each other. Of the
four occasions mathematically possible in which
the day and the month can be equal, there are
only two which at present need engage our attention&mdash;one
of these occurred near the beginning
of the earth and moon's history, the other remains
to be approached in the immeasurably remote
future. The two remaining solutions are futile,
being what the mathematician would describe as
imaginary.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between the
dynamical conditions in these critical epochs&mdash;in
one of them the energy of the system has attained
a maximum value, and in the other the energy of
the system is at a minimum value. It is impossible
to over-estimate the significance of these two
states of the system.</p>

<p>I may recall the fundamental notion which every
one has learned in mechanics, as to the difference
between stable and unstable equilibrium. The
conceivable possibility of making an egg stand on
its end is a practical impossibility, because nature
does not like unstable equilibrium, and a body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
departs therefrom on the least disturbance; on
the other hand, stable equilibrium is the position in
which nature tends to place everything. A log of
wood floating on a river might conceivably float
in a vertical position with its end up out of the
water, but you never could succeed in so balancing
it, because no matter how carefully you adjusted
the log, it would almost instantly turn over when
you left it free; on the other hand, when the log
floats naturally on the water it assumes a horizontal
position, to which, when momentarily displaced
therefrom, it will return if permitted to
do so. We have here an illustration of the contrast
between stable and unstable equilibrium.
It will be found generally that a body is in
equilibrium when its centre of gravity is at its
highest point or at its lowest point; there is,
however, this important difference, that when the
centre of gravity is highest the equilibrium is
unstable, and when the centre of gravity is lowest
the equilibrium is stable. The potential energy
of an egg poised on its end in unstable equilibrium
is greater than when it lies on its side
in stable equilibrium. In fact, energy must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
expended to raise the egg from the horizontal
position to the vertical; while, on the other hand,
work could conceivably be done by the egg when
it passes from the vertical position to the horizontal.
Speaking generally, we may say that the stable
position indicates low energy, while a redundancy
of that valuable agent is suggestive of instability.</p>

<p>We may apply similar principles to the consideration
of the earth-moon system. It is true
that we have here a series of dynamical phenomena,
while the illustrations I have given of
stable and unstable equilibrium relate only to
statical problems; but we can have dynamical stability
and dynamical instability, just as we can
have stable and unstable equilibrium. Dynamical
instability corresponds with the maximum of
energy, and dynamical stability to the minimum
of energy.</p>

<p>At that primitive epoch, when the energy of the
earth-moon system was a maximum, the condition
was one of dynamical instability; it was impossible
that it should last. But now mark how truly
critical an occurrence this must have been in the
history of the earth-moon system, for have I not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
already explained that it is a necessary condition
of the progress of tidal evolution that the energy
of the system should be always declining? But
here our retrospect has conducted us back to a
most eventful crisis, in which the energy was a
maximum, and therefore cannot have been immediately
preceded by a state in which the energy
was greater still; it is therefore impossible for the
tidal evolution to have produced this state of
things; some other influence must have been in
operation at this beginning of the earth-moon
system.</p>

<p>Thus there can be hardly a doubt that immediately
preceding the critical epoch the moon
originated from the earth in the way we have
described. Note also that this condition, being
one of maximum energy, was necessarily of dynamical
instability, it could not last; the moon
must adopt either of two courses&mdash;it must tumble
back on the earth, or it must start outwards.
Now which course was the moon to adopt? The
case is analogous to that of an egg standing on
its end&mdash;it will inevitably tumble one way or
the other. Some infinitesimal cause will produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a tendency towards one side, and to that side
accordingly the egg will fall. The earth-moon
system was similarly in an unstable state, an infinitesimal
cause might conceivably decide the fate
of the system. We are necessarily in ignorance
of what the determining cause might have been,
but the effect it produced is perfectly clear; the
moon did not again return to its mother earth, but
set out on that mighty career which is in progress
to-day.</p>

<p>Let it be noted that these critical epochs in
the earth-moon history arise when and only
when there is an absolute identity between the
length of the month and the length of the day.
It may be proper therefore that I should provide
a demonstration of the fact, that the identity
between these two periods must necessarily
have occurred at a very early period in the
evolution.</p>

<p>The law of Kepler, which asserts that the square
of the periodic time is proportioned to the cube
of the mean distance, is in its ordinary application
confined to a comparison between the revolutions
of the several planets about the sun. The periodic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
time of each planet is connected with its average
distance by this law; but there is another application
of Kepler's law which gives us information
of the distance and the period of the moon in
former stages of the earth-moon history. Although
the actual path of the moon is of course
an ellipse, yet that ellipse is troubled, as is well
known, by many disturbing forces, and from this
cause alone the actual path of the moon is far
from being any of those simple curves with which
we are so well acquainted. Even were the earth
and the moon absolutely rigid particles, perturbations
would work all sorts of small changes in
the pliant curve. The phenomena of tidal evolution
impart an additional element of complexity into
the actual shape of the moon's path. We now see
that the ellipse is not merely subject to incessant
deflections of a periodic nature, it also undergoes
a gradual contraction as we look back through
time past; but we may, with all needful accuracy
for our present purpose, think of the path of the
moon as a circle, only we must attribute to that
circle a continuous contraction of its radius the
further and the further we look back. The alteration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in the radius will be even so slow, that the moon
will accomplish thousands of revolutions around
the earth without any appreciable alteration in
the average distance of the two bodies. We can
therefore think of the moon as revolving at every
epoch in a circle of special radius, and as accomplishing
that revolution in a special time. With
this understanding we can now apply Kepler's law
to the several stages of the moon's past history.
The periodic time of each revolution, and the mean
distance at which that revolution was performed,
will be always connected together by the formula
of Kepler. Thus to take an instance in the very
remote past. Let us suppose that the moon was
at one hundred and twenty thousand miles instead
of two hundred and forty thousand, that is, at
half its present distance. Applying the law of
Kepler, we see that the time of revolution must
then have been only about ten days instead of the
twenty-seven it is now. Still further, let us suppose
that the moon revolves in an orbit with one-tenth
of the diameter it has at present, then the
cube of 10 being 1000, and the square root of 1000
being 31.6, it follows that the month must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
been less than the thirty-first part of what it is
at present, that is, it must have been considerably
less than one of our present days. Thus you see the
month is growing shorter and shorter the further
we look back, the day is also growing shorter and
shorter; but still I think we can show that there
must have been a time when the month will have
been at least as short as the day. For let us take
the most extreme case in which the moon shall
have made the closest possible approximation to
the earth. Two globes in contact will have a
distance between their centres which is equal to
the sum of their radii. Take the earth as having
a radius of four thousand miles, and the moon a
radius of one thousand miles, the two centres must
at their shortest distance be five thousand miles
apart, that is, the moon must then be at the forty-eighth
part of its present distance from the earth.
Now the cube of 48 is 110,592, and the square root
of 110,592 is nearly 333, therefore the length of the
month will be one-three hundred and thirty-third
part of the duration of the month at present; in
other words, the moon must revolve around the
earth in a period of somewhat about two hours. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
seems impossible that the day can ever have been
as brief as this. We have therefore proved that, in
the course of its contracting duration, the moon
must have overtaken the contracting day, and that
therefore there must have been a time when the
moon was in the vicinity of the earth, and having
a day and month of equal period. Thus we have
shown that the critical condition of dynamical
instability must have occurred in the early period
of the earth-moon history, if the agents then in
operation were those which we now know. The
further development of the subject must be postponed
until the next lecture.</p>



<h2><a name="LECTURE_II" id="LECTURE_II"></a>LECTURE II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Starting</span> from that fitting commencement of
earth-moon history which the critical epoch affords,
we shall now describe the dynamical phenomena
as the tidal evolution progressed. The moon and
the earth initially moved as a solid body, each
bending the same face towards the other; but as
the moon retreated, and as tides began to be
raised on the earth, the length of the day began
to increase, as did also the length of the month.
We know, however, that the month increased more
rapidly than the day, so that a time was reached
when the month was twice as long as the day;
and still both periods kept on increasing, but not
at equal rates, for in progress of time the month
grew so much more rapidly than the day, that
many days had to elapse while the moon accomplished
a single revolution. It is, however, only
necessary for us to note those stages of the mighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
progress which correspond to special events. The
first of such stages was attained when the month
assumed its maximum ratio to the day. At this
time, the month was about twenty-nine days,
and the epoch appears to have occurred at a
comparatively recent date if we use such
standards of time as tidal evolution requires;
though measured by historical standards, the epoch
is of incalculable antiquity. I cannot impress
upon you too often the enormous magnitude of
the period of time which these phenomena have
required for their evolution. Professor Darwin's
theory affords but little information on this point,
and the utmost we can do is to assign a minor
limit to the period through which tidal evolution
has been in progress. It is certain that the birth
of the moon must have occurred at least fifty
million years ago, but probably the true period
is enormously greater than this. If indeed we
choose to add a cipher or two to the figure just
printed, I do not think there is anything which
could tell us that we have over-estimated the
mark. Therefore, when I speak of the epoch in
which the month possessed the greatest number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
days as a recent one, it must be understood that
I am merely speaking of events in relation to the
order of tidal evolution. Viewed from this standpoint,
we can show that the epoch is a recent one
in the following manner. At present the month
consists of a little more than twenty-seven days,
but at this maximum period to which I have
referred the month was about twenty-nine days;
from that it began to decline, and the decline
cannot have proceeded very far, for even still there
are only two days less in the month than at the
time when the month had the greatest number of
days. It thus follows that the present epoch&mdash;the
human epoch, as we may call it&mdash;in the history
of the earth has fallen at a time when the progress
of tidal evolution is about half-way between the
initial and the final stage. I do not mean half-way
in the sense of actual measurement of years;
indeed, from this point it would seem that we
cannot yet be nearly half-way, for, vast as are the
periods of time that have elapsed since the moon
first took its departure from the earth, they fall far
short of that awful period of time which will intervene
between the present moment and the hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
when the next critical state of earth-moon history
shall have been attained. In that state the day is
destined once again to be equal to the month, just
as was the case in the initial stage. The half-way
stage will therefore in one sense be that in which
the proportion of the month to the day culminates.
This is the stage which we have but lately passed;
and thus it is that at present we may be said to
be almost half-way through the progress of tidal
evolution.</p>

<p>My narrative of the earth-moon evolution must
from this point forward cease to be retrospective.
Having begun at that critical moment when the
month and day were first equal, we have traced
the progress of events to the present hour. What
we have now to say is therefore a forecast of
events yet to come. So far as we can tell, no agent
is likely to interfere with the gradual evolution
caused by the tides, which dynamical principles
have disclosed to us. As the years roll on, or
perhaps, I should rather say, as thousands of
years and millions of years roll on, the day will
continue to elongate, or the earth to rotate more
slowly on its axis. But countless ages must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
elapse before another critical stage of the history
shall be reached. It is needless for me to ponder
over the tedious process by which this interesting
epoch is reached. I shall rather sketch what
the actual condition of our system will be when
that moment shall have arrived. The day will
then have expanded from the present familiar
twenty-four hours up to a day more than twice,
more than five, even more than fifty times its
present duration. In round numbers, we may say
that this great day will occupy one thousand four
hundred of our ordinary hours. To realize the
critical nature of the situation then arrived at, we
must follow the corresponding evolution through
which the moon passes. From its present distance
of two hundred and forty thousand miles, the
moon will describe an ever-enlarging orbit; and
as it does so the duration of the month will also
increase, until at last a point will be reached when
the month has become more than double its
present length, and has attained the particular
value of one thousand four hundred hours. We
are specially to observe that this one-thousand
four-hundred-hour month will be exactly reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
when the day has also expanded to one thousand
four hundred hours; and the essence of this critical
condition, which may be regarded as a significant
point of tidal evolution, is that the day and the
month have again become equal. The day and
the month were equal at the beginning, the day
and the month will be equal at the end. Yet how
wide is the difference between the beginning and
the end. The day or the month at the end is some
hundreds of times as long as the month or the day
at the beginning.</p>

<p>I have already fully explained how, in any stage
of the evolutionary progress in which the day and
the month became equal, the energy of the system
attained a maximum or a minimum value. At
the beginning the energy was a maximum; at the
end the energy will be a minimum. The most
important consequences follow from this consideration.
I have already shown that a condition of
maximum energy corresponded to dynamic instability.
Thus we saw that the earth-moon history
could not have commenced without the intervention
of some influence other than tides at the
beginning. Now let us learn what the similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
doctrine has to tell us with regard to the end.
The condition then arrived at is one of dynamical
stability; for suppose that the system were to
receive a slight alteration, by which the moon went
out a little further, and thus described a larger
orbit, and so performed more than its share of the
moment of spin. Then the earth would have to
do a little less spinning, because, under all circumstances,
the total quantity of spin must be preserved
unaltered. But the energy being at a
minimum, such a small displacement must of
course produce a state of things in which the
energy would be increased. Or if we conceived
the moon to come in towards the earth, the moon
would then contribute less to the total moment
of momentum. It would therefore be incumbent
on the earth to do more; and accordingly the
velocity of the earth's rotation would be augmented.
But this arrangement also could only be
produced by the addition of some fresh energy
to the system, because the position from which
the system is supposed to have been disturbed
is one of minimum energy.</p>

<p>No disturbance of the system from this final<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
position is therefore conceivable, unless some
energy can be communicated to it. But this will
demonstrate the utter incompetency of the tides
to shift the system by a hair's breadth from this
position; for it is of the essence of the tides to
waste energy by friction. And the transformations
of the system which the tides have caused are
invariably characterized by a decline of energy,
the movements being otherwise arranged so that
the total moment of momentum shall be preserved
intact. Note, how far we were justified in speaking
of this condition as a final one. It is final
so far as the lunar tides are concerned; and were
the system to be screened from all outer interference,
this accommodation between the earth
and the moon would be eternal.</p>

<p>There is indeed another way of demonstrating
that a condition of the system in which the day
has assumed equality with the month must necessarily
be one of dynamical equilibrium. We have
shown that the energy which the tides demand is
derived not from the mere fact that there are high
tides and low tides, but from the circumstance
that these tides do rise and fall; that in falling and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
rising they do produce currents; and it is these
currents which generate the friction by which the
earth's velocity is slowly abated, its energy wasted,
and no doubt ultimately dissipated as heat. If
therefore we can make the ebbing and the flowing
of the tides to cease, then our argument will disappear.
Thus suppose, for the sake of illustration,
that at a moment when the tides happened to be
at high water in the Thames, such a change
took place in the behaviour of the moon that the
water always remained full in the Thames, and at
every other spot on the earth remained fixed at
the exact height which it possessed at this particular
moment. There would be no more tidal
friction, and therefore the system would cease to
course through that series of changes which the
existence of tidal friction necessitates.</p>

<p>But if the tide is always to be full in the Thames,
then the moon must be always in the same position
with respect to the meridian, that is, the moon must
always be fixed in the heavens over London. In
fact, the moon must then revolve around the earth
just as fast as London does&mdash;the month must have
the same length as the day. The earth must then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
show the same face constantly to the moon, just as
the moon always does show the same face towards
the earth; the two globes will in fact revolve as
if they were connected with invisible bonds, which
united them into a single rigid body.</p>

<p>We need therefore feel no surprise at the cessation
of the progress of tidal evolution when the
month and the day are equal, for then the movement
of moon-raised tides has ceased. No doubt
the same may be said of the state at the beginning
of the history, when the day and the month had
the brief and equal duration of a few hours. While
the equality of the two periods lasted there could
be no tides, and therefore no progress in the
direction of tidal evolution. There is, however, the
profound difference of stability and instability between
the two cases; the most insignificant disturbance
of the system at the initial stage was
sufficient to precipitate the revolving moon from its
condition of dynamical equilibrium, and to start
the course of tidal evolution in full vigour. If,
however, any trifling derangement should take
place in the last condition of the system, so that
the month and the day departed slightly from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
equality, there would instantly be an ebbing and a
flowing of the tides; and the friction generated by
these tides would operate to restore the equality
because this condition is one of dynamical stability.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen with what justice we can
look forward to the day and month each of fourteen
hundred hours as a finale to the progress of
the luni-tidal evolution. Throughout the whole of
this marvellous series of changes it is always necessary
to remember the one constant and invariable
element&mdash;the moment of momentum of the system
which tides cannot alter. Whatever else the friction
can have done, however fearful may have been the
loss of energy by the system, the moment of momentum
which the system had at the beginning it
preserves unto the end. This it is which chiefly
gives us the numerical data on which we have to
rely for the quantitative features of tidal evolution.</p>

<p>We have made so many demands in the course
of these lectures on the capacity of tidal friction
to accomplish startling phenomena in the evolution
of the earth-moon system, that it is well for us
to seek for any evidence that may otherwise be
obtainable as to the capacity of tides for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
accomplishment of gigantic operations. I do not
say that there is any doubt which requires to be
dispelled by such evidence, for as to the general
outlines of the doctrine of tidal evolution which
has been here sketched out there can be no reasonable
ground for mistrust; but nevertheless it is
always desirable to widen our comprehension of
any natural phenomena by observing collateral
facts. Now there is one branch of tidal action
to which I have as yet only in the most incidental
way referred. We have been speaking of the tides
in the earth which are made to ebb and flow by
the action of the moon; we have now to consider
the tides in the moon, which are there excited by
the action of the earth. For between these two
bodies there is a reciprocity of tidal-making energy&mdash;each
of them is competent to raise tides in the
other. As the moon is so small in comparison with
the earth, and as the tides on the moon are of
but little significance in the progress of tidal evolution,
it has been permissible for us to omit them
from our former discussion. But it is these tides
on the moon which will afford us a striking illustration
of the competency of tides for stupendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
tasks. The moon presents a monument to show
what tides are able to accomplish.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo003.jpg"><img src="images/illo003_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;The Moon.</p>

<p>I must first, however, explain a difficulty which
is almost sure to suggest itself when we speak of
tides on the moon. I shall be told that the moon
contains no water on its surface, and how then, it
will be said, can tides ebb and flow where there is
no sea to be disturbed? There are two answers
to this difficulty; it is no doubt true that the moon
seems at present entirely devoid of water in so far
as its surface is exposed to us, but it is by no
means certain that the moon was always in this
destitute condition. There are very large features
marked on its map as &#8220;seas&#8221;; these regions are
of a darker hue than the rest of the moon's surface,
they are large objects often many hundreds
of miles in diameter, and they form, in fact, those
dark patches on the brilliant surface which are
conspicuous to the unaided eye, and are represented
in Fig. 3. Viewed in a telescope these so-called
seas, while clearly possessing no water at the
present time, are yet widely different from the
general aspect of the moon's surface. It has
often been supposed that great oceans once filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
these basins, and a plausible explanation has
even been offered as to how the waters they once
contained could have vanished. It has been
thought that as the mineral substances deep in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the interior of our satellite assumed the crystalline
form during the progress of cooling, the demand
for water of crystallization required for incorporation
with the minerals was so great that the
oceans of the moon became entirely absorbed.
It is, however, unnecessary for our present argument
that this theory should be correct. Even if there
never was a drop of water found on our satellite,
the tides in its molten materials would be quite
sufficient for our purpose; anything that tides
could accomplish would be done more speedily by
vast tides of flowing lava than by merely oceanic
tides.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that tides raised on the
moon by the earth would be greater than the tides
raised on the earth by the moon. The question is,
however, not a very simple one, for it depends on
the masses of both bodies as well as on their
relative dimensions. In so far as the masses are
concerned, the earth being more than eighty times
as heavy as the moon, the tides would on this
account be vastly larger on the moon than on the
earth. On the other hand, the moon's diameter
being much less than that of the earth, the efficiency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of a tide-producing body in its action on
the moon would be less than that of the same
body at the same distance in its action on the
earth; but the diminution of the tides from this
cause would be not so great as their increase from
the former cause, and therefore the net result
would be to exhibit much greater tides on the moon
than on the earth.</p>

<p>Suppose that the moon had been originally
endowed with a rapid movement of rotation
around its axis, the effect of the tides on that
rotation would tend to check its velocity just in the
same way as the tides on the earth have effected
a continual elongation of the day. Only as the
tides on the moon were so enormously great,
their capacity to check the moon's speed would
have corresponding efficacy. In addition to this,
the mass of the moon being so small, it could only
offer feeble resistance to the unceasing action of
the tide, and therefore our satellite must succumb
to whatever the tides desired ages before our
earth would have been affected to a like extent.
It must be noticed that the influence of the tidal
friction is not directed to the total annihilation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the rotation of the two bodies affected by it; the
velocity is only checked down until it attains such
a point that the speed in which each body rotates
upon its axis has become equal to that in which
it revolves around the tide-producer. The practical
effect of such an adjustment is to make the tide-agitated
body turn a constant face towards its
tormentor.</p>

<p>I may here note a point about which people
sometimes find a little difficulty. The moon
constantly turns the same face towards the
earth, and therefore people are sometimes apt
to think that the moon performs no rotation
whatever around its own axis. But this is indeed
not the case. The true inference to be drawn
from the constant face of the moon is, that the
velocity of rotation about its own axis is equal to
that of its rotation around the earth; in fact, the
moon revolves around the earth in twenty-seven
days, and its rotation about its axis is performed
in twenty-seven days also. You may illustrate the
movement of the moon around the earth by walking
around a table in a room, keeping all the time
your face turned towards the table; in such a case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
as this you not only perform a motion of revolution,
but you also perform a rotation in an equal
period. The proof that you do rotate is to be found
in the fact that during the movement your face is
being directed successively to all the points of the
compass. There is no more singular fact in the
solar system than the constancy of the moon's
face to the earth. The periods of rotation and
revolution are both alike; if one of these periods
exceeded the other by an amount so small as the
hundredth part of a second, the moon would in the
lapse of ages permit us to see that other side which
is now so jealously concealed. The marvellous
coincidence between these two periods would be
absolutely inexplicable, unless we were able to
assign it to some physical cause. It must be remembered
that in this matter the moon occupies a
unique position among the heavenly host. The sun
revolves around on its axis in a period of twenty-five
or twenty-six days&mdash;thus we see one side of the
sun as frequently as we see the other. The side of
the sun which is turned towards us to-day is almost
entirely different from that we saw a fortnight ago.
Nor is the period of the sun's rotation to be identified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
with any other remarkable period in our
system. If it were equal to the length of the year,
for instance, or if it were equal to the period of any
of the other planets, then it could hardly be contended
that the phenomenon as presented by the
moon was unique; but the sun's period is not
simply related, or indeed related at all, to any of
the other periodic times in the system. Nor do
we find anything like the moon's constancy of
face in the behaviour of the other planets. Jupiter
turns now one face to us and then another. Nor
is his rotation related to the sun or related to any
other body, as our moon's motion is related to
us. It has indeed been thought that in the movements
of the satellites of Jupiter a somewhat
similar phenomenon may be observed to that in
the motion of our own satellite. If this be so, the
causes whereby this phenomenon is produced are
doubtless identical in the two cases.</p>

<p>So remarkable a coincidence as that which the
moon's motion shows could not reasonably be
explained as a mere fortuitous circumstance; nor
need we hesitate to admit that a physical explanation
is required when we find a most satisfactory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
one ready for our acceptance, as was originally
pointed out by Helmholtz.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt whatever that the constancy
of the moon's face is the work of ancient
tides, which have long since ceased to act. We
have shown that if the moon's rotation had once
been too rapid to permit of the same face being
always directed towards us, the tides would operate
as a check by which the velocity of that rotation
would be abated. On the other hand, if the moon
rotated so slowly that its other face would be exposed
to us in the course of the revolution, the tides
would then be dragged violently over its surface
in the direction of its rotation; their tendency
would thus be to accelerate the speed until the
angular velocity of rotation was equal to that of
revolution. Thus the tides would act as a controlling
agent of the utmost stringency to hurry the moon
round when it was not turning fast enough, and to
arrest the motion when going too fast. Peace there
would be none for the moon until it yielded absolute
compliance to the tyranny of the tides, and adjusted
its period of rotation with exact identity
to its period of revolution. Doubtless this adjustment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
was made countless ages ago, and since that
period the tides have acted so as to preserve
the adjustment, as long as any part of the moon
was in a state sufficiently soft or fluid to respond
to tidal impression. The present state of the
moon is a monument to which we may confidently
appeal in support of our contention as
to the great power of the tides during the ages
which have passed; it will serve as an illustration
of the future which is reserved for our earth in
ages yet to come, when our globe shall have also
succumbed to tidal influence.</p>

<p>It is owing to the smallness of the moon relatively
to the earth that the tidal process has reached a
much more advanced stage in the moon than it
has on the earth; but the moon is incessant in its
efforts to bring the earth into the same condition
which it has itself been forced to assume. Thus
again we look forward to an epoch in the inconceivably
remote future when tidal thraldom shall be
supreme, and when the earth shall turn the same
face to the moon, as the moon now turns the
same face to the earth.</p>

<p>In the critical state of things thus looming in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the dim future, the earth and the moon will continue
to perform this adjusted revolution in a period
of about fourteen hundred hours, the two bodies
being held, as it were, by invisible bands. Such
an arrangement might be eternal if there were no
intrusion of tidal influence from any other body;
but of course in our system as we actually find it
the sun produces tides as well as the moon; and
the solar tides being at present much less than
those originated by the moon, we have neglected
them in the general outlines of the theory. The
solar tides, however, must necessarily have an
increasing significance. I do not mean that they
will intrinsically increase, for there seems no
reason to apprehend any growth in their actual
amount; it is their relative importance to the
lunar tides that is the augmenting quantity. As
the final state is being approached, and as the
velocity of the earth's rotation is approximating to
the angular velocity with which the moon revolves
around it, the ebbing and the flowing of the lunar
tides must become of evanescent importance; and
this indeed for a double reason, partly on account
of the moon's greatly augmented distance, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
partly on account of the increasing length of the
lunar day, and the extremely tardy movements of
ebb and flow that the lunar tides will then have.
Thus the lunar tides, so far as their dynamical
importance is concerned, will ultimately become
zero, while the solar tides retain all their pristine
efficiency.</p>

<p>We have therefore to examine the dynamical
effects of solar tides on the earth and moon in
the critical stage to which the present course of
things tends. The earth will then rotate in a period
of about fifty-seven of its present days; and considering
that the length of the day, though so
much greater than our present day, is still much
less than the year, it follows that the solar tides
must still continue so as to bring the earth's
velocity of rotation to a point even lower than
it has yet attained. In fact, if we could venture
to project our glance sufficiently far into the
future, it would seem that the earth must ultimately
have its velocity checked by the sun-raised
tides, until the day itself had become equal to
the year. The dynamical considerations become,
however, too complex for us to follow them, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that I shall be content with merely pointing out
that the influence of the solar tides will prevent the
earth and moon from eternally preserving the relations
of bending the same face towards each other;
the earth's motion will, in fact, be so far checked,
that the day will become <i>longer</i> than the month.</p>

<p>Thus the doctrine of tidal evolution has conducted
us to a prospect of a condition of things
which will some time be reached, when the moon
will have receded to a distance in which the month
shall have become about fifty-seven days, and
when the earth around which this moon revolves
shall actually require a still longer period to accomplish
its rotation on its axis. Here is an odd
condition for a planet with its satellite; indeed,
until a dozen years ago it would have been pronounced
inconceivable that a moon should whirl
round a planet so quickly that its journey was
accomplished in less than one of the planet's own
days. Arguments might be found to show that this
was impossible, or at least unprecedented. There
is our own moon, which now takes twenty-seven
days to go round the earth; there is Jupiter, with
four moons, and the nearest of these to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
primary goes round in forty-two and a half hours.
No doubt this is a very rapid motion; but all
those matters are much more lively with Jupiter
than they are here. The giant planet himself
does not need ten hours for a single rotation,
so that you see his nearest moon still takes between
two and three Jovian days to accomplish a
single revolution. The example of Saturn might
have been cited to show that the quickest revolution
that any satellite could perform must still
require at least twice as long as the day in which
the planet performed its rotation. Nor could the
rotation of the planets around the sun afford a
case which could be cited. For even Mercury, the
nearest of all the planets to the sun of which the
existence is certainly known, and therefore the
most rapid in its revolution, requires eighty-eight
days to get round once; and in the mean time the
sun has had time to accomplish between three and
four rotations. Indeed, the analogies would seem to
have shown so great an improbability in the conclusion
towards which tidal evolution points, that
they would have contributed a serious obstacle to
the general acceptance of that theory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>But in 1877 an event took place so interesting
in astronomical history, that we have to look back
to the memorable discovery of Uranus in 1781
before we can find a parallel to it in importance.
Mars had always been looked upon as one of the
moonless planets, though grounds were not wanting
for the surmise that probably moons to Mars
really existed. It was under the influence of this
belief that an attempt was made by Professor
Asaph Hall at Washington to make a determined
search, and see if Mars might not be attended by
satellites large enough to be discoverable. The
circumstances under which this memorable inquiry
was undertaken were eminently favourable for its
success. The orbit of Mars is one which possesses
an exceptionally high eccentricity; it consequently
happens that the oppositions during which the
planet is to be observed vary very greatly in the
facilities they afford for a search like that contemplated
by Professor Hall. It is obviously
advantageous that the planet should be situated
as near as possible to the earth, and in the opposition
in 1877 the distance was almost at the
lowest point it is capable of attaining; but this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was not the only point in which Professor Hall
was favoured; he had the use of a telescope of
magnificent proportions and of consummate optical
perfection. His observatory was also placed
in Washington, so that he had the advantage of a
pure sky and of a much lower latitude than any
observatory in Great Britain is placed at. But the
most conspicuous advantage of all was the practised
skill of the astronomer himself, without which all
these other advantages would have been but of
little avail. Great success rewarded his well-designed
efforts; not alone was one satellite discovered
which revolved around the planet in a
period conformable with that of other similar cases,
but a second little satellite was found, which accomplished
its revolution in a wholly unexpected and
unprecedented manner. The day of Mars himself,
that is, the period in which he can accomplish a
rotation around his axis, very closely approximates
to our own day, being in fact half an hour longer.
This little satellite, the inner and more rapid of
the pair, requires for a single revolution a period
of only seven hours thirty-nine minutes, that is to
say, the little body scampers more than three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
times round its primary before the primary itself
has finished one of its leisurely rotations. Here
was indeed a striking fact, a unique fact in our
system, which riveted the attention of astronomers
on this most beautiful discovery.</p>

<p>You will now see the bearing which the movement
of the inner satellite of Mars has on the
doctrine of tidal evolution. As a legitimate consequence
of that doctrine, we came to the conclusion
that our earth-moon system must ultimately
attain a condition in which the day is longer than
the month. But this conclusion stood unsupported
by any analogous facts in the more anciently-known
truths of astronomy. The movement of
the satellite of Mars, however, affords the precise
illustration we want; and this fact, I think, adds
an additional significance to the interest and the
beauty of Professor Hall's discovery.</p>

<p>It is of particular interest to investigate the
possible connection which the phenomena of tidal
evolution may have had in connection with the
geological phenomena of the earth. We have
already pointed out the greater closeness of the
moon to us in times past. The tides raised by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
moon on the earth must therefore have been
greater in past ages than they are now, for of
course the nearer the moon the bigger the tide.
As soon as the earth and the moon had separated
to a considerable distance we may say that the
height of the tide will vary inversely as the cube
of the moon's distance; it will therefore happen,
that when the moon was at half its present distance
from us, his tide-producing capacity was not alone
twice as much or four times as much, but even
eight times as much as it is at present; and a
much greater rate of tidal rise and fall indicates,
of course, a preponderance in every other
manifestation of tidal activity. The tidal currents,
for instance, must have been much greater in
volume and in speed; even now there are places
in which the tidal currents flow at four or more
miles per hour. We can imagine, therefore, the
vehemence of the tidal currents which must have
flowed in those days when the moon was a much
smaller distance from us. It is interesting to view
these considerations in their possible bearings on
geological phenomena. It is true that we have here
many elements of uncertainty, but there is, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a certain general outline of facts which may
be laid down, and which appears to be instructive,
with reference to the past history of our earth.</p>

<p>I have all through these lectures indicated a
mighty system of chronology for the earth-moon
system. It is true that we cannot give our chronology
any accurate expression in years. The various
stages of this history are to be represented by the
successive distances between the earth and the
moon. Each successive epoch, for instance, may
be marked by the number of thousands of miles
which separate the moon from the earth.</p>

<p>But we have another system of chronology derived
from a wholly different system of ideas; it too
relates to periods of vast duration, and, like our
great tidal periods, extends to times anterior to
human history, or even to the duration of human
life on this globe. The facts of geology open up
to us a majestic chronology, the epochs of which
are familiar to us by the succession of strata
forming the crust of the earth, and by the succession
of living beings whose remains these strata
have preserved. From the present or recent age
our retrospect over geological chronology leads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
us to look through a vista embracing periods of
time overwhelming in their duration, until at last
our view becomes lost, and our imagination is
baffled in the effort to comprehend the formation
of those vast stratified rocks, a dozen miles or
more in thickness, which seem to lie at the very
base of the stratified system on the earth, and in
which it would appear that the dawnings of life
on this globe may be almost discerned. We have
thus the two systems of chronology to compare&mdash;one,
the astronomical chronology measured by
the successive stages in the gradual retreat of the
moon; the other, the geological chronology
measured by the successive strata constituting
the earth's crust. Never was a more noble problem
proposed in the physical history of our earth than
that which is implied in the attempt to correlate
these two systems of chronology. What we would
especially desire to know is the moon's distance
which corresponds to each of the successive strata
on the earth. How far off, for instance, was that
moon which looked down on the coal forests in
the time of their greatest luxuriance? or what
was the apparent size of the full moon at which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the ichthyosaurus could have peeped when he
turned that wonderful eye of his to the sky on
a fine evening? But interesting as this great
problem is, it lies, alas! outside the possibility
of exact solution. Indeed we shall not make any
attempt which must necessarily be futile to correlate
these chronologies; all we can do is to
state the one fact which is absolutely undeniable
in the matter.</p>

<p>Let us fix our attention on that specially interesting
epoch at the dawn of geological time, when
those mighty Laurentian rocks were deposited of
which the thickness is so astounding, and let us
consider what the distance of the moon must have
been at this initial epoch of the earth's history.
All we know for certain is, that the moon must
have been nearer, but what proportion that distance
bore to the present distance is necessarily quite
uncertain. Some years ago I delivered a lecture
at Birmingham, entitled &#8220;A Glimpse through the
Corridors of Time,&#8221; and in that lecture I threw
out the suggestion that the moon at this primeval
epoch may have only been at a small fraction of
its present distance from us, and that consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
terrific tides may in these days have ravaged the
coast. There was a good deal of discussion on
the subject, and while it was universally admitted
that the tides must have been larger in pal&aelig;ozoic
times than they are at present, yet there was a
considerable body of opinion to the effect that the
tides even then may have been only about twice,
or possibly not so much, greater than those tides
we have at the present. What the actual fact
may be we have no way of knowing; but it is
interesting to note that even the smallest accession
to the tides would be a valuable factor in the performance
of geological work.</p>

<p>For let me recall to your minds a few of the
fundamental phenomena of geology. Those stratified
rocks with which we are now concerned have
been chiefly manufactured by deposition of sediment
in the ocean. Rivers, swollen, it may be, by
floods, and turbid with a quantity of material held
in suspension, discharge their waters into the sea.
Granting time and quiet, this sediment falls to the
bottom; successive additions are made to its
thickness during centuries and thousands of years,
and thus beds are formed which in the course of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
ages consolidate into actual rock. In the formation
of such beds the tides will play a part. Into the
estuaries at the mouths of rivers the tides hurry in
and hurry out, and especially during spring tides
there are currents which flow with tremendous
power; then too, as the waves batter against the
coast they gradually wear away and crumble down
the mightiest cliffs, and waft the sand and mud
thus produced to augment that which has been
brought down by the rivers. In this operation also
the tides play a part of conspicuous importance,
and where the ebb and flow is greatest it is obvious
that an additional impetus will be given to the
manufacture of stratified rocks. In fact, we may
regard the waters of the globe as a mighty mill,
incessantly occupied in grinding up materials
for future strata. The main operating power of
this mill is of course derived from the sun, for it
is the sun which brings up the rains to nourish the
rivers, it is the sun which raises the wind which
lashes the waves against the shore. But there is
an auxiliary power to keep the mill in motion,
and that auxiliary power is afforded by the tides.
If then we find that by any cause the efficiency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the tides is increased we shall find that the mill
for the manufacture of strata obtains a corresponding
accession to its capacity. Assuming the
estimate of Professor Darwin, that the tide may
have had twice as great a vertical range of ebb and
flow within geological times as it has at present,
we find a considerable addition to the efficiency
of the ocean in the manufacture of the ancient
stratified rocks. It must be remembered that the
extent of the area through which the tides will
submerge and lay bare the country, will often be
increased more than twofold by a twofold increase
of height. A little illustration may show what I
mean. Suppose a cone to be filled with water up
to a certain height, and that the quantity of
water in it be measured; now let the cone be
filled until the water is at double the depth; then
the surfaces of the water in the two cases will be
in the ratio of the circles, one of which has double
the diameter of the other. The areas of the two
surfaces are thus as four to one; the volumes of the
waters in the two cases will be in the proportion
of two similar solids, the ratios of their dimensions
being as two to one. Of course this means that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the water in the one case would be eight times
as much as in the other. This particular illustration
will not often apply exactly to tidal phenomena,
but I may mention one place that I happen
to know of, in the vicinity of Dublin, in which
the effect of the rise and fall of the tide would
be somewhat of this description. At Malahide
there is a wide shallow estuary cut off from
the sea by a railway embankment, and there is a
viaduct in the embankment through which a great
tidal current flows in and out alternately. At
low tide there is but little water in this estuary, but
at high tide it extends for miles inland. We may
regard this inlet with sufficient approximation to
the truth as half of a cone with a very large angle,
the railway embankment of course forming the
diameter; hence it follows that if the tide was to
be raised to double its height, so large an area of
additional land would be submerged, and so vast an
increase of water would be necessary for the purpose,
that the flow under the railway bridge would
have to be much more considerable than it is at
present. In some degree the same phenomena will
be repeated elsewhere around the coast. Simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
multiplying the height of the tide by two would
often mean that the border of land between high
and low water would be increased more than twofold,
and that the volume of water alternately
poured on the land and drawn off it would be
increased in a still larger proportion. The velocity
of all tidal currents would also be greater than
at present, and as the power of a current of water
for transporting solid material held in suspension
increases rapidly with the velocity, so we may infer
that the efficiency of tidal currents as a vehicle for
the transport of comminuted rocks would be greatly
increased. It is thus obvious that tides with a
rise and fall double in vertical height of those
which we know at present would add a large increase
to their efficiency as geological agents. Indeed,
even were the tides only half or one-third
greater than those we know now, we might reasonably
expect that the manufacture of stratified rocks
must have proceeded more rapidly than at present.</p>

<p>The question then will assume this form. We
know that the tides must have been greater in
Cambrian or Laurentian days than they are at
present; so that they were available as a means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
assisting other agents in the stupendous operations
of strata manufacture which were then conducted.
This certainly helps us to understand
how these tremendous beds of strata, a dozen
miles or more in solid thickness, were deposited.
It seems imperative that for the accomplishment
of a task so mighty, some agents more potent than
those with which we are familiar should be required.
The doctrine of tidal evolution has shown
us what those agents were. It only leaves us uninformed
as to the degree in which their mighty
capabilities were drawn upon.</p>

<p>It is the property of science as it grows to find
its branches more and more interwoven, and this
seems especially true of the two greatest of all
natural sciences&mdash;geology and astronomy. With
the beginnings of our earth as a globe in the shape
in which we find it both these sciences are directly
concerned. I have here touched upon another
branch in which they illustrate and confirm each
other.</p>

<p>As the theory of tidal evolution has shed such a
flood of light into the previously dark history of
our earth-moon system, it becomes of interest to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
see whether the tidal phenomena may not have a
wider scope; whether they may not, for instance,
have determined the formation of the planets by
birth from the sun, just as the moon seems to have
originated by birth from the earth. Our first
presumption, that the cases are analogous, is not
however justified when the facts are carefully
inquired into. A principle which I have not
hitherto discussed here assumes prominence, and
therefore we shall devote our attention to it for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>Let us understand what we mean by the solar
system. There is first the sun at the centre, which
preponderates over all the other bodies so enormously,
as shown in Fig. 4, in which the earth and
the sun are placed side by side for comparison.
There is then the retinue of planets, among the
smaller of which our earth takes its place, a view
of the comparative sizes of the planets being
shown in Fig. 5.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Comparative sizes of Earth and Sun.</p>


<p>Not to embarrass ourselves with the perplexities
of a problem so complicated as our solar system is
in its entirety, we shall for the sake of clear reasoning
assume an ideal system, consisting of a sun and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a large planet&mdash;in fact, such as our own system
would be if we could withdraw from it all other
bodies, leaving the sun and Jupiter only remaining.
We shall suppose, of course, that the sun is much
larger than the planet, in fact, it will be convenient
to keep in mind the relative masses of the
sun and Jupiter, the weight of the planet being less
than one-thousandth part of the sun. We know, of
course, that both of those bodies are rotating upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
their axes, and the one is revolving around the
other; and for simplicity we may further suppose
that the axes of rotation are perpendicular to the
plane of revolution. In bodies so constituted tides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
will be manifested. Jupiter will raise tides in the
sun, the sun will raise tides in Jupiter. If the
rotation of each body be performed in a less period
than that of the revolution (the case which alone
concerns us), then the tides will immediately
operate in their habitual manner as a brake for the
checking of rotation. The tides raised by the sun
on Jupiter will tend therefore to lengthen Jupiter's
day; the tides raised on the sun by Jupiter will
tend to augment the sun's period of rotation. Both
Jupiter and the sun will therefore lose some moment
of momentum. We cannot, however, repeat too
often the dynamical truth that the total moment
of momentum must remain constant, therefore
what is lost by the rotation must be made up
in the revolution; the orbit of Jupiter around the
sun must accordingly be swelling. So far the
reasoning appears similar to that which led to
such startling consequences in regard to the moon.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo005.jpg"><img src="images/illo005_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Comparative sizes of Planets.</p>

<p>But now for the fundamental difference between
the two cases. The moon, it will be remembered,
always revolves with the same face towards the
earth. The tides have ceased to operate there, and
consequently the moon is not able to contribute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
any moment of momentum, to be applied to the
enlargement of its distance from the earth; all the
moment of momentum necessary for this purpose
is of course drawn from the single supply in the
rotation of the earth on its axis. But in the case
of the system consisting of the sun and Jupiter
the circumstances are quite different&mdash;Jupiter does
not always bend the same face to the sun; so
far, indeed, is this from being true, that Jupiter
is eminently remarkable for the rapidity of his
rotation, and for the incessantly varying aspect in
which he would be seen from the sun. Jupiter has
therefore a store of available moment of momentum,
as has also of course the sun. Thus in the sun
and planet system we have in the rotations two
available stores of moment of momentum on which
the tides can make draughts for application to the
enlargement of the revolution. The proportions
in which these two available sources can be drawn
upon for contributions is not left arbitrary. The
laws of dynamics provide the shares in which each
of the bodies is to contribute for the joint purpose
of driving them further apart.</p>

<p>Let us see if we cannot form an estimate by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
elementary considerations as to the division of the
labour. The tides raised on Jupiter by the sun
will be practically proportional to the sun's mass
and to the radius of Jupiter. Owing to the enormous
size of the sun, the efficiency of these tides and the
moment of the friction-brake they produce will be
far greater on the planet than will the converse
operation of the planet be on the sun. Hence it
follows that the efficiency of the tides in depriving
Jupiter of moment of momentum will be greatly
superior to the efficiency of the tides in depriving
the sun of moment of momentum. Without
following the matter into any close numerical calculation,
we may assert that for every one part the
sun contributes to the common object, Jupiter will
contribute at least a thousand parts; and this
inequality appears all the more striking, not to say
unjust, when it is remembered that the sun is
more abundantly provided with moment of momentum
than is Jupiter&mdash;the sun has, in fact, about
twenty thousand times as much.</p>

<p>The case may be illustrated by supposing that a
rich man and a poor man combine together to
achieve some common purpose to which both are to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
contribute. The ethical notion that Dives shall
contribute largely, according to his large means, and
Lazarus according to his slender means, is quite
antagonistic to the scale which dynamics has
imposed. Dynamics declares that the rich man
need only give a penny to every pound that has to
be extorted from the poor man. Now this is precisely
the case with regard to the sun and Jupiter,
and it involves a somewhat curious consequence.
As long as Jupiter possesses available moment of
momentum, we may be certain that no large contribution
of moment of momentum has been
obtained from the sun. For, returning to our
illustration, if we find that Lazarus still has something
left in his pocket, we are of course assured
that Dives cannot have expended much, because, as
Lazarus had but little to begin with, and as Dives
only puts in a penny for every pound that Lazarus
spends, it is obvious that no large amount can have
been devoted to the common object. Hence it
follows that whatever transfer of moment of momentum
has taken place in the sun-Jupiter system
has been almost entirely obtained at the expense
of Jupiter. Now in the solar system at present,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the orbital moment of momentum of Jupiter is
nearly fifty thousand times as great as his present
store of rotational moment of momentum. If,
therefore, the departure of Jupiter from the sun
had been the consequence of tidal evolution, it
would follow that Jupiter must once have contained
many thousands of times the moment of momentum
that he has at present. This seems utterly incredible,
for even were Jupiter dilated into an enormously
large mass of vaporous matter, spinning
round with the utmost conceivable speed, it is impossible
that he should ever have possessed enough
moment of momentum. We are therefore forced
to the conclusion that the tides alone do not provide
sufficient explanation for the retreat of Jupiter
from the sun.</p>

<p>There is rather a subtle point in the considerations
now brought forward, on which it will be
necessary for us to ponder. In the illustration
of Dives and Lazarus, the contributions of Lazarus
of course ceased when his pockets were exhausted,
but those of Dives will continue, and in the lapse
of time may attain any amount within the utmost
limits of Dives' resources. The essential point to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
notice is, that so long as Lazarus retains anything
in <i>his</i> pocket, we know for certain that Dives has
not given much; if Lazarus, however, has his
pocket absolutely empty, and if we do not know
how long they may have been in that condition, we
have no means of knowing how large a portion
of wealth Dives may not have actually expended.
The turning-point of the theory thus involves the
fact that Jupiter still retains available moment
of momentum in his rotation; and this was our
sole method of proving that the sun, which in
this case was Dives, had never given much. But
our argument must have taken an entirely
different line had it so happened that Jupiter
constantly turned the same face to the sun, and
that therefore his pockets were entirely empty in
so far as available moment of momentum is concerned.
It would be apparently impossible for us
to say to what extent the resources of the sun
may not have been drawn upon; we can, however,
calculate whether in any case the sun could possibly
have supplied enough moment of momentum to
account for the recession of Jupiter. Speaking
in round numbers, the revolutional moment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
momentum of Jupiter is about thirty times as great
as the rotational moment of momentum at present
possessed by the sun. I do not know that there is
anything impossible in the supposition that the
sun might, by an augmented volume and an augmented
velocity of rotation, contain many times
the moment of momentum that it has at this
moment. It therefore follows that if it had happened
that Jupiter constantly bent the same face
to the sun, there would apparently be nothing
impossible in the fact that Jupiter had been born
of the sun, just as the moon was born of the earth.
These same considerations should also lead us
to observe with still more special attention the
development of the earth-moon system. Let us
restate the matter of the earth and moon in the
light which the argument with respect to Jupiter
has given us. At present the rotational moment
of momentum of the earth is about a fifth part
of the revolutional moment of momentum of the
moon. Owing to the fact that the moon keeps
the same face to us, she has now no available
moment of momentum, and all the moment of
momentum required to account for her retreat has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of late come from the rotation of the earth; but
suppose that the moon still had some liquid on
its surface which could be agitated by tides,
suppose further that it did not always bend the
same face towards us, that it therefore had some
available moment of momentum due to its rotation
on which the tides could operate, then see how
the argument would have been altered. The
gradual increase of the moon's distance could be
provided for by a transfer of moment of momentum
from two sources, due of course to the rotational
velocities of the two bodies. Here again the moon
and the earth will contribute according to that
dynamical but very iniquitous principle which
regulated the appropriations from the purses of
Dives and Lazarus. The moon must give not
according to her abundance, but in the inverse
ratio thereof&mdash;because she has little she must give
largely. Nor shall we make an erroneous estimate
if we say that nine-tenths of the whole moment
of momentum necessary for the enlargement of
the orbit would have been exacted from the moon;
that means that the moon must once have had
about five or six times as much moment of momentum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as the earth possesses at this moment.
Considering the small size of the moon, this could
only have arisen by terrific velocity of rotation,
which it is inconceivable that its materials could
ever have possessed.</p>

<p>This presents the demonstration of tidal evolution
in a fresh light. If the moon now departed to
any considerable extent from showing the constant
face to the earth, it would seem that its retreat
could not have been caused by tides. Some other
agent for producing the present configuration would
be necessary, just as we found that some other
agent than the tides has been necessary in the case
of Jupiter.</p>

<p>But I must say a few words as to the attitude
of this question with regard to the entire solar
system. This system consists of the sun presiding
at the centre, and of the planets and their satellites
in revolution around their respective primaries, and
each also animated by a rotation on its axis. I
shall in so far depart from the actual configuration
of the system as to transform it into an ideal
system, whereof the masses, the dimensions, and
the velocities shall all be preserved; but that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
several planes of revolution shall be all flattened
into one plane, instead of being inclined at small
angles as they are at present; nor will it be unreasonable
for us at the same time to bring into
parallelism all the axes of rotation, and to arrange
that their common directions shall be perpendicular
to the plane of their common orbits. For the
purpose of our present research this ideal system
may pass for the real system.</p>

<p>In its original state, whatever that state may
have been, a magnificent endowment was conferred
upon the system. Perhaps I may, without derogation
from the dignity of my subject, speak of the
endowment as partly personal and partly entailed.
The system had of course different powers with regard
to the disposal of the two portions; the personal
estate could be squandered. It consisted entirely of
what we call energy; and considering how frequently
we use the expression conservation of energy, it
may seem strange to say now that this portion
of the endowment has been found capable of alienation,
nay, further, that our system has been squandering
it persistently from the first moment until
now. Although the doctrine of the conservation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of energy is, we have every reason to believe, a
fundamental law affecting the whole universe, yet
it would be wholly inaccurate to say that any
particular system such as our solar system shall
invariably preserve precisely the same quantity
of energy without alteration. The circumstance that
heat is a form of energy indeed negatives this
supposition. For our system possesses energy of
all the different kinds: there is energy due to the
motions both of rotation and of revolution; there
is energy due to the fact that the mutually attracting
bodies of our system are separated by distances
of enormous magnitude; and there is also energy
in the form of heat; and the laws of heat permit
that this form of energy shall be radiated off into
space, and thus disappear entirely, in so far as our
system is concerned. On the other hand, there may
no doubt be some small amount of energy accruing
to our system from the other systems in space,
which like ours are radiating forth energy. Any
gain from this source, however, is necessarily so
very small in comparison to the loss to which we
have referred, that it is quite impossible that the
one should balance the other. Though it is undoubtedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
true that the total quantity of energy in
the universe is constant, yet the share of that
energy belonging to any particular system such as
ours declines steadily from age to age.</p>

<p>I may indeed remark, that the question as to
what becomes of all the radiant energy which the
millions of suns in the universe are daily discharging
offers a problem apparently not easy to solve;
but we need not discuss the matter at present, we
are only going to trace out the vicissitudes of our
own system; and whatever other changes that
system may exhibit, the fact is certain that the
total quantity of energy it contains is declining.</p>

<p>Of the two endowments of energy and of moment
of momentum originally conferred on our system
the moment of momentum is the entailed estate.
No matter how the bodies may move, no matter
how their actions may interfere with one another,
no matter how this body is pulled one way and the
other body that way, the conservation of moment
of momentum is not imperilled, nor, no matter
what losses of heat may be experienced by radiation,
could the store of moment of momentum be
affected. The only conceivable way in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
quantity of moment of momentum in the solar
system could be tampered with is by the interference
of some external attracting body. We
know, however, that the stars are all situated at
such enormous distances, that the influences they
can exert in the perturbation of the solar system
are absolutely insensible; they are beyond the
reach of the most delicate astronomical measurements.
Hence we see how the endowment of
the system with moment of momentum has conferred
upon that system a something which is
absolutely inalienable, even to the smallest portion.</p>

<p>Before going any further it would be necessary
for me to explain more fully than I have hitherto
done the true nature of the method of estimating
moment of momentum. The moment of momentum
consists of two parts: there is first that due to the
revolution of the bodies around the sun; there is
secondly the rotation of these bodies on their axes.
Let us first think simply of a single planet revolving
in a circular orbit around the sun. The
momentum of that planet at any moment may
be regarded as the product of its mass and its
velocity; then the moment of momentum of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
planet in the case mentioned is found by multiplying
the momentum by the radius of the path
pursued. In a more general case, where the planet
does not revolve in a circle, but pursued an elliptic
path, the moment of momentum is to be found by
multiplying the planet's velocity and its mass into
the perpendicular from the sun on the direction in
which the planet is moving.</p>

<p>These rules provide the methods for estimating
all the moments of momentum, so far as the
revolutions in our system are concerned. For the
rotations somewhat more elaborate processes are
required. Let us think of a sphere rotating round
a fixed axis. Every particle of that sphere will of
course describe a circle around the axis, and all
these circles will lie in parallel planes. We may
for our present purpose regard each atom of the
body as a little planet revolving in a circular
orbit, and therefore the moment of momentum of
the entire sphere will be found by simply adding
together the moments of momentum of all the
different atoms of which the sphere is composed.
To perform this addition the use of an elaborate
mathematical method is required. I do not propose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to enter into the matter any further, except
to say that the total moment of momentum is the
product of two factors&mdash;one the angular velocity
with which the sphere is turning round, while the
other involves the sphere's mass and dimensions.</p>

<p>To illustrate the principles of the computation
we shall take one or two examples. Suppose that
two circles be drawn, one of which is double the
diameter of the other. Let two planets be taken
of equal mass, and one of these be put to revolve
in one circle, and the other to revolve in the
other circle, in such a way that the periods of
both revolutions shall be equal. It is required to
find the moments of momentum in the two cases.
In the larger of the two circles it is plain that the
planet must be moving twice as rapidly as in the
smaller, therefore its momentum is twice as great;
and as the radius is also double, it follows that the
moment of momentum in the large orbit will be
four times that in the small orbit. We thus see
that the moment of momentum increases in the
proportion of the squares of the radii. If, however,
the two planets were revolving about the same sun,
one of these orbits being double the other, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
periodic times could not be equal, for Kepler's
law tells us that the square of the periodic time
is proportional to the cube of the mean distance.
Suppose, then, that the distance of the first
planet is 1, and that of the second planet is 2,
the cubes of those numbers are 1 and 8, and therefore
the periodic times of the two bodies will be
as 1 to the square root of 8. We can thus see that
the velocity of the outer body must be less than
that of the inner one, for while the length of the
path is only double as large, the time taken to
describe that path is the square root of eight times
as great; in fact, the velocity of the outer body
will be only the square root of twice that of the
inner one. As, however, its distance from the sun
is twice as great, it follows that the moment of
momentum of the outer body will be the square
root of twice that of the inner body. We may
state this result a little more generally as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>In comparing the moments of momentum of the
several planets which revolve around the sun, that
of each planet is proportional to the product of its
mass with the square root of its distance from
the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now compare two spheres together, the
diameter of one sphere being double that of the
other, while the times of rotation of the two are
identical. And let us now compare together the
moments of momentum in these two cases. It
can be shown by reasoning, into which I need not
now enter, that the moment of momentum of the
large sphere will be thirty-two times that of the
small one. In general we may state that if a
sphere of homogeneous material be rotating about
an axis, its moment of momentum is to be expressed
by the product of its angular velocity by
the fifth power of its radius.</p>

<p>We can now take stock, as it were, of the constituents
of moments of momentum in our system.
We may omit the satellites for the present, while
such unsubstantial bodies as comets and such small
bodies as meteors need not concern us. The present
investment of the moment of momentum of our
system is to be found by multiplying the mass of
each planet by the square root of its distance
from the sun; these products for all the several
planets form the total revolutional moment of
momentum. The remainder of the investment is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in rotational moment of momentum, the collective
amount of which is to be estimated by multiplying
the angular velocity of each planet into its density,
and the fifth power of its radius if the planet be
regarded as homogeneous, or into such other
power as may be necessary when the planet is
not homogeneous. Indeed, as the denser parts
of the planet necessarily lie in its interior, and have
therefore neither the velocity nor the radius of the
more superficial portions, it seems necessary to
admit that the moments of momentum of the
planets will be proportional to some lower power
of the radius than the fifth. The total moment
of momentum of the planets by rotation, when
multiplied by a constant factor, and added to the
revolutional moment of momentum, will remain
absolutely constant.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note the present disposition
of this vast inheritance among the different
bodies of our system. The biggest item of all is
the moment of momentum of Jupiter, due to its
revolution around the sun; in fact, in this single
investment nearly sixty per cent. of the total
moment of momentum of the solar system is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
found. The next heaviest item is the moment of
momentum of Saturn's revolution, which is twenty-four
per cent. Then come the similar contributions
of Uranus and Neptune, which are six
and eight per cent. respectively. Only one more
item is worth mentioning, as far as magnitude
is concerned, and that is the nearly two per
cent. that the sun contains in virtue of its <i>rotation</i>.
In fact, all the other moments of momentum are
comparatively insignificant in this method of viewing
the subject. Jupiter from his rotation has not
the fifty thousandth part of his revolutional moment
of momentum, while the earth's rotational share
is not one ten thousandth part of that of Jupiter,
and therefore is without importance in the general
aspect of the system. The revolution of the earth
contributes about one eight hundredth part of
that of Jupiter.</p>

<p>These facts as here stated will suffice for us to
make a forecast of the utmost the tides can effect
in the future transformation of our system. We
have already explained that the general tendency
of tidal friction is to augment revolutional moment
of momentum at the expense of rotational. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
total, however, of the rotational moment of momentum
of the system barely reaches two per cent.
of the whole amount; this is of course almost entirely
contributed by the sun, for all the planets
together have not a thousandth part of the sun's
rotational moment. The utmost therefore that tidal
evolution can effect in the system is to distribute the
two per cent. in augmenting the revolutionary moment
of momentum. It does not seem that this can
produce much appreciable derangement in the
configuration of the system. No doubt if it were
all applied to one of the smaller planets it would
produce very considerable effect. Our earth, for
instance, would have to be driven out to a distance
many hundreds of times further than it is at
present were the sun's disposable moment of momentum
ultimately to be transferred to the earth
alone. On the other hand, Jupiter could absorb
the whole of the sun's share by quite an insignificant
enlargement of its present path. It does
not seem likely that the distribution that must
ultimately take place can much affect the present
configuration of the system.</p>

<p>We thus see that the tides do not appear to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
have exercised anything like the same influence
in the affairs of our solar system generally which
they have done in that very small part of the
solar system which consists of the earth and moon.
This is, as I have endeavoured to show in these
lectures, the scene of supremely interesting tidal
phenomena; but how small it is in comparison
with the whole magnitude of our system may be
inferred from the following illustration. I represent
the whole moment of momentum of our
system by &pound;1,000,000,000, the bulk of which is
composed of the revolutional moments of momentum
of the great planets, and the rotational
moment of momentum of the sun. On this scale
the rotational share which has fallen to our earth
and moon does not even rise to the dignity of
a single pound, it can only be represented by the
very modest figure of 19<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> This is divided
into two parts&mdash;the earth by its rotation accounts
for 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, leaving 16<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> as the equivalent of
the revolution of the moon. The other inferior
planets have still less to show than the earth.
Venus can barely have more than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; even
Mars' two satellites cannot bring his figure up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
beyond the slender value of 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>; while Mercury
will be amply represented by the smallest coin
known at her Majesty's mint.</p>

<p>The same illustration will bring out the contrast
between the Jovian system and our earth system.
The rotational share of the former would be totally
represented by a sum of nearly &pound;12,000; of this,
however, Jupiter's satellites only contribute about
&pound;89, notwithstanding that there are four of them.
Thus Jupiter's satellites have not one hundredth
part of the moment of momentum which the
rotation of Jupiter exhibits. How wide is the contrast
between this state of things and the earth-moon
system, for the earth does not contain in its
rotation one-fifth of the moment of momentum
that the moon has in its revolution; in fact, the
moon has gradually robbed the earth, which originally
possessed 19<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, of which the moon has
carried off all but 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>And this process is still going on, so that ultimately
the earth will be left very poor, though not
absolutely penniless, at least if the retention of a
halfpenny can be regarded as justifying that assertion.
Saturn, revolving as it does with great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
rapidity, and having a very large mass, possesses
about &pound;2700, while Uranus and Neptune taken
together would figure for about the same amount.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us revert again to the two
critical conditions of the earth-moon system. As to
what happened before the first critical period, the
tides tell us nothing, and every other line of reasoning
very little; we can to some extent foresee
what may happen after the second critical epoch is
reached, at a time so remote that I do not venture
even to express the number of ciphers which ought
to follow the significant digit in the expression
for the number of years. I mentioned, however,
that at this time the sun tides will produce the
effect of applying a still further brake to the rotation
of the earth, so that ultimately the month will
have become a shorter period than the day. It is
therefore interesting for us to trace out the tidal
history of a system in which the satellite revolves
around the primary in less time than the primary
takes to go round on its own axis&mdash;such a system,
in fact, as Mars would present at this moment were
the outer satellite to be abstracted. The effect of
the tides on the planet raised by its satellite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
would then be to accelerate its rotation; for
as the planet, so to speak, lags behind the tides,
friction would now manifest itself by the continuous
endeavour to drag the primary round
faster. The gain of speed, however, thus attained
would involve the primary in performing more than
its original share of the moment of momentum;
less moment of momentum would therefore remain
to be done by the satellite, and the only way to
accomplish this would be for the satellite to come
inwards and revolve in a smaller orbit.</p>

<p>We might indeed have inferred this from the
considerations of energy alone, for whatever happens
in the deformation of the orbit, heat is produced
by the friction, and this heat is lost, and the
total energy of the system must consequently
decline. Now if it be a consequence of the tides
that the velocity of the primary is accelerated, the
energy corresponding to that velocity is also
increased. Hence the primary has more energy
than it had before; this energy must have been obtained
at the expense of the satellite; the satellite
must therefore draw inwards until it has yielded
up enough of energy not alone to account for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the increased energy of the primary, but also for
the absolute loss of energy by which the whole
operation is characterized.</p>

<p>It therefore appears that in the excessively
remote future the retreat of the moon will not
only be checked, but that the moon may actually
return to a point to be determined by the changes
in the earth's rotation. It is, however, extremely
difficult to follow up the study of a case where the
problem of three bodies has become even more
complicated than usual.</p>

<p>The importance of tidal evolution in our solar
system has also to be viewed in connection with
the celebrated nebular hypothesis of the origin of
the solar system. Of course it would be understood
that tidal evolution is in no sense a rival doctrine
to that of the nebular theory. The nebular origin
of the sun and the planets sculptured out the main
features of our system; tidal evolution has merely
come into play as a subsidiary agent, by which a
detail here or a feature there has been chiselled into
perfect form. In the nebular theory it is believed
that the planets and the sun have all originated
from the cooling and the contraction of a mighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
heated mass of vapours. Of late years this theory,
in its main outlines at all events, has strengthened
its hold on the belief of those who try to interpret
nature in the past by what we see in the present.
The fact that our system at present contains some
heat in other bodies as well as in the sun, and the
fact that the laws of heat require continual loss by
radiation, demonstrate that our system, if we look
back far enough, and if the present laws have acted,
must have had in part, at all events, an origin like
that which the nebular theory would suppose.</p>

<p>I feel that I have in the progress of these two
lectures been only able to give the merest outline
of the theory of tidal evolution in its application
to the earth-moon system. Indeed I have been
obliged, by the nature of the subject, to omit almost
entirely any reference to a large body of the parts
of the theory. I cannot bring myself to close these
lectures without just alluding to this omission, and
without giving expression to the fact, that I feel it
is impossible for me to have rendered adequate
justice to the strength of the argument on which
we claim that tidal evolution is the most rational
mode of accounting for the present condition in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
which we find the earth-moon system. Of course
it will be understood that we have never contended
that the tides offer the only conceivable theory as
to the present condition of things. The argument
lies in this wise. A certain body of facts are patent
to our observation. The tides offer an explanation
as to the origin of these facts. The tides are
a <i>vera causa</i>, and in the absence of other suggested
causes, the tidal theory holds the field. But much
will depend on the volume and the significance of
the group of associated facts of which the doctrine
offers a solution. The facts that it has been in
my power to discuss within the compass of discourses
like the present, only give a very meagre
and inadequate notion of the entire phenomena
connected with the moon which the tides will
explain. We have not unfrequently, for the sake
of simplicity, spoken of the moon's orbit as circular,
and we have not even alluded to the fact that
the plane of that orbit is inclined to the ecliptic.
A comprehensive theory of the moon's origin
should render an account of the eccentricity of the
moon's orbit; it must also involve the obliquity of
the ecliptic, the inclination of the moon's orbit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and the direction of the moon's axis. I have been
perforce compelled to omit the discussion of these
attributes of the earth-moon system, and in doing
so I have inflicted what is really an injustice on
the tidal theory. For it is the chief claim of the
theory of tidal evolution, as expounded by Professor
Darwin, that it links together all these various
features of the earth-moon system. It affords a
connected explanation, not only of the fact that the
moon always turns the same face to the earth, but
also of the eccentricity of the moon's path around
the earth, and the still more difficult points about
the inclinations of the various axes and orbits of
the planets. It is the consideration of these points
that forms the stronghold of the doctrine of tidal
evolution. For when we find that a theory depending
upon influences that undoubtedly exist,
and are in ceaseless action around us, can at the
same time bring into connection and offer a
common explanation of a number of phenomena
which would otherwise have no common bond of
union, it is impossible to refuse to believe that such
a theory does actually correspond to nature.</p>

<p>The greatest of mathematicians have ever found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in astronomy problems which tax, and problems
which greatly surpass, the utmost efforts of which
they are capable. The usual way in which the
powers of the mathematician have been awakened
into action is by the effort to remove some glaring
discrepancy between an imperfect theory and the
facts of observation. The genius of a Laplace or
a Lagrange was expended, and worthily expended,
in efforts to show how one planet acted on another
planet, and produced irregularities in its orbit;
the genius of an Adams and a Leverrier was
nobly applied to explain the irregularities in
the motion of Uranus, and to discover a cause
of those irregularities in the unseen Neptune.
In all these cases, and in many others which
might be mentioned, the mathematician has
been stimulated by the laudable anxiety to clear
away some blemish from the theory of gravitation
throughout the system. The blemish was seen to
exist before its removal was suggested. In that
application of mathematics with which we have
been concerned in these lectures the call for the
mathematician has been of quite a different kind.
A certain familiar phenomenon on our sea-coasts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
has invited attention. The tidal ripples murmur a
secret, but not for every ear. To interpret that
secret fully, the hearer must be a mathematician.
Even then the interpretation can only be
won after the profoundest efforts of thought
and attention, but at last the language has been
made intelligible. The labour has been gloriously
rewarded, and an interesting chapter of
our earth's history has for the first time been
written.</p>

<p>In the progress of these lectures I have sought
to interest you in those profound investigations
which the modern mathematician has made in his
efforts to explore the secrets of nature. He has
felt that the laws of motion, as we understand
them, are bounded by no considerations of space,
are limited by no duration of time, and he has
commenced to speculate on the logical consequences
of those laws when time of indefinite
duration is assumed to be at his disposal. From
the very nature of the case, observations for confirmation
were impossible. Phenomena that required
millions of years for their development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cannot be submitted to the instruments in our
observatories. But this is perhaps one of the
special reasons which make such investigations of
peculiar interest, and entitle us to speak of the
revelations of Time and Tide as a romance of
modern science.</p>
